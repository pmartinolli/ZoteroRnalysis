"SCGDUZSR","book","2004","Wardrip-Fruin, Noah; Harrigan, Pat","First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game","","0-262-23232-4","","","","The third book in a multivolume series dedicated to the critical study of the virtual worlds of video game narrative and story. Third Person examines vast narratives across diverse media ranging from comic books to television and video games to literature. Electronic games have established a huge international market, significantly outselling non-digital games; people spend more money on The Sims than on ""Monopoly"" or even on ""Magic: the Gathering."" Yet it is widely believed that the market for electronic literature -- predicted by some to be the future of the written word -- languishes. Even bestselling author Stephen King achieved disappointing results with his online publication of ""Riding the Bullet"" and ""The Plant."" Isn't it possible, though, that many hugely successful computer games -- those that depend on or at least utilize storytelling conventions of narrative, character, and theme -- can be seen as examples of electronic literature? And isn't it likely that the truly significant new forms of electronic literature will prove to be (like games) so deeply interactive and procedural that it would be impossible to present them as paper-like ""e-books""? The editors of First Person have gathered a remarkably diverse group of new media theorists and practitioners to consider the relationship between ""story"" and ""game,"" as well as the new kinds of artistic creation (literary, performative, playful) that have become possible in the digital environment. This landmark collection is organized as a series of discussions among creators and theorists; each section includes three presentations, with each presentation followed by two responses. Topics considered range from ""Cyberdrama"" to ""Ludology"" (the study of games), to ""The Pixel/The Line"" to ""Beyond Chat."" The conversational structure inspired contributors to revise, update, and expand their presentations as they prepared them for the book, and the panel discussions have overflowed into a First Person web site (created in conjunction with the online journal Electronic Book Review).","2004","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-02-09 15:51:34","","","331","","1","3","","FirstPerson","","","","","The MIT Press","Cambridge, MA","en","","","","","Primo","GV1469.17.S63","","","","","_major publication; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One might even see gaming as an attempt to find friends and build that political community of which Aristotle says friendship is the root. The really interesting thing about gamers is that, as they play Dungeons Dragons, they at one and the same time build bonds between their characters and between each other as players. The trajectory of these bonds often mirrors the trajectory of friendships we find in epic fantasy literature where the characters, at first suspicious of each other, in the end have developed true friendships and established peaceful kingdoms where chaos had reigned before. Aristotle's philosophy of friendship can help us to understand this development. Dungeons Dragons players know a lot about friendship and the value of friendship in a person's life, despite the popular depiction of gamers.","2014","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:55:42","2015-05-15 18:25:36","202-216","","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","en","Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","_philosophy; _player; _dnd; _TTRPG; _belonging; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Robichaud, Christopher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So the idea of immersion is central to understanding how Dungeons Dragons and other aspects of participatory culture work. Phenomenology is a kind of “philosophy of mind” associated with the works of twentieth-century philosophers Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, among others. The domain of phenomenology encompasses the entire range of experiences in the world, paying attention to what Husserl called “intentionality,” or how our consciousness is directed toward particular objects in the world. The fact that this is presented as an atypical approach to play, or at least one that requires some effort, invites us to ask about typical modes of play if visualization of in-game events is not that mode.

First of all, it means that nobody chooses evil for the sake of evil, what some people call diabolic evil. The primary sources of evil are indifference and self-deception. Both lead me to a life of convention, simply living up to the code of conduct given by society. It is much more comfortable to think of evil as something done by villains in movies.

However, there is one that stands above all others. It is the Master of Past and Present, Raistlin Majere. This chapter is concerned with a seemingly simple question: who is Raistlin Majere? Of course, he is the brother of Caramon Majere. He is the wizard with golden skin and hourglass pupils. He is the Master of Past and Present. The chapter answers the question of what makes it true that it was a single person that accomplished all of the extraordinary feats that Raistlin did.","2014","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:55:42","2015-05-15 18:29:50","132-144","","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","Hoboken, NJ","en","Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","_philosophy; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Robichaud, Christopher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The necromancer is often depicted as a mere cackling villain, using her power over death to forward her evil agenda. In this way, necromancy has been philosophically maligned. Although necromancers were traditionally considered to be evil in Dungeons Dragons (DD), the game came to accommodate the idea that necromancers, in theory, could be neutral, or even good-aligned, with their powers used for the greater good. The distaste for necromancy and its mindless minions is instead a relic of “pre-theoretical intuition” a common-sense belief that may not hold up to philosophical scrutiny. Films and TV series depict the walking dead as ravenous, brain-eating monstrosities. Next to such depictions, the relatively harmless nature of Dungeons Dragons’ mindless undead is easy to overlook.","2014","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:55:42","2015-05-15 18:29:50","145-162","","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","Malden, MA","en","Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","_philosophy; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Robichaud, Christopher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mages usually interact with animals in two ways: First, the author can summon animals by using animal-summoning or monster-summoning spells. Second, a mage can summon animals to be familiar. A familiar was once a normal animal that has been transformed into magical beast with unique powers and abilities. Bats, cats, hawks, and rats are examples of common familiar companions. The rights ethicist Tom Regan argues that animals have particular rights because they are subjects of a life, meaning that they seek to satisfy specific preferences and interests. As Lord Acton wrote, “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” It appears that this also holds in Dungeons Dragons (DD). Thus, when playing a character who can summon nonhuman animals, it may be wise to take the ethics into account when deciding what actions are best.","2014","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:55:42","2015-05-15 18:29:50","163-171","","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","en","Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","_philosophy; _dnd; _monster; _TTRPG; _belonging; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Robichaud, Christopher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In frustration, they methodically kill, threaten, and chase away any quest-givers that approach them. The chapter looks at early adventure games based on DD, asking why they avoid many aspects of the game, especially those that involve role-playing and moral decisions by players. It then discusses how gamers now discover DD, and why this is important in changing their understanding of the game. The chapter addresses the question: why Pierre Levy's ideas about the digital age, virtual communities, and collective intelligence are so important for understanding how, and why this has happened.

One would be hard pressed to argue that cartoonishly large breasts and skin-tight leather skirts really allow for dexterous swordplay or quick getaways. DD liberates us from the limitations of our sex by making male and female characters equal in terms of abilities. The shyest of men can be the most outspoken of wizards, the most honest girl can play the most unscrupulous rogue, and the pacifist woman can don full armor and fly into a berserker rage on a group of bugbears ambushing her adventuring party because, after all, bugbears are her species enemy and she just can't help herself when they are around.","2014","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:55:41","2015-05-15 18:29:50","189-201","","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","en","Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","","","","Wiley Online Library","","","","","","_philosophy; _dnd; _gender; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","Robichaud, Christopher","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Individual chapters survey the perspectives, concepts, and findings on RPGs from key disciplines, like performance studies, sociology, psychology, education, economics, game design, literary studies, and more. Other chapters integrate insights from RPG studies around broadly significant topics, like transmedia worldbuilding, immersion, transgressive play, or player–character relations.

It emphasizes the subjective psychological interpretations of role-playing through various perspectives, including phenomenology, hobbyist theories, role-play studies, and psychoanalysis. The chapter presents the evidence that can be leveraged from the psychological sciences, based on empirical research in the positivist tradition and the uses and conjectures of other forms of analysis. Cognitive psychology studies the mind and mental function, including learning, memory, attention, perception, reasoning, language, conceptual development, cognitive capacities, and decision-making. Most research on the cognitive effects of games has attempted to understand the links between video game play and aggression. Some see a causal connection, while others refute it. Psychologists have examined why games appear to be highly motivating. Indeed, looking for motivational effects has been one of the more fruitful empirical approaches to the psychological study of games, including digital and analog role-playing games in schools.","2018","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:55:18","","245-264","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","London","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","DOI:10.4324/9781315637532-13 QID: Q113460396","","","","_major publication; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =blogged; =cleaned; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Deterding, Sebastian; Zagal, José P.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The chapter presents social stratification research that highlights noteworthy trends related to class, education, religion, gender, sexuality, race, and ethnicity in RPGs from a realist perspective. Sociologists often study players' experiences and behaviors in and around RPGs. This has to do with what many see as inherently attractive about RPGs – the interactive environments within which groups can collaboratively construct an imagined world and then act in it. RPGs facilitate many different player configurations and types of social interaction.

They take a fundamental form of play – make-believe – and a fundamental aspect of social reality and identity – roles – and give them the structured form of a game. RPGs involve play. Play transforms and recombines other, functional behaviors, exaggerating, varying, and rendering them incomplete so they lack their ""serious"" consequences and thus their obvious instrumental or survival value. RPGs involve roles, another universal human phenomenon that has been studied for over a century. Roles are patterns of behaviors and attitudes expected from a person occupying a given social position. In terms of play, RPGs provide insight into adult pretense and role-play, which occur in many places besides RPGs: many board, card, and video games have moments of emergent micro-role-play. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book.","2018","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-24 16:58:37","2019-05-14 14:45:07","1-16","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","New York","en","","","","","","","DOI: 10.4324/9781315637532-1","","","","_major publication; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _LARP; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY; _MEDIA","","Zagal, José P.; Deterding, Sebastian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In their foundational game studies text Rules of Play, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman acknowledge that their definition of a game considers RPGs a borderline case. When scholars, designers, and fans use the words ""role-playing games"", they typically do not speak about all phenomena called ""role-playing games"" but usually refer to one of several clusters of phenomena, which we call forms. The empirical phenomena referred to as ""role-playing games"" are very heterogeneous, spanning different socio-material assemblages: joint talk and paper inscriptions, joint embodiment, and single and networked computing devices. Role-playing games is a word used by multiple social groups to refer to multiple forms and styles of play activities and objects revolving around the rule-structured creation and enactment of characters in a fictional world. However, because ""role-playing games"" is a social category created by humans, it has no unchanging, context-independent essence.","2018-04-17","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-24 16:58:57","2019-05-14 14:47:15","19-51","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","New York","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.4324/9781315637532-2","","","","_major publication; _rpg theory; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned","","Zagal, José P.; Deterding, Sebastian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It situates the Forge within the broader context of TRPG discourse, and connects “Forge theory” to the academic investigation of role-playing.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-02-06 21:30:19","2020-09-13 23:58:16","","283","","","","","Tabletop RPG Design in Theory and Practice at the Forge, 2001–2012","Palgrave Games in Context","","","","Springer Nature","Cham","en","","","","","www.palgrave.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-52819-5","","","","_major publication; _publishing; _the forge; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _HISTORYOFRPG","Social Science / Media Studies; Language Arts & Disciplines / Communication Studies; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Social Science / General; Social Science / Popular Culture; Sports & Recreation / Sociology of Sports","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It shows how the conversation inside the hobby sought to establish what a role-playing game was or should be, accompanied by a conversation in the mass media that framed role-playing as an activity for youth and made either condescending or alarmist normative judgments about those who engaged in it. It offers those conversations as the context in which two seminal essays written by a tabletop RPG (TRPG) designer named Ron Edwards served as the impetus for the Forge as a place to pursue the internal discourse—in other words, as a place to take role-playing games seriously.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:57:57","2021-05-08 01:41:25","1-31","","","","","","Before the Forge","Palgrave Games in Context","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-52819-5_1","","","","_rpg theory; _the forge; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","White, William J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Completing such projects increases their ‘indie cred,’ and both posting and working on projects provide experience that may develop their skills.

It pays some attention to the experiences of marginalization and exclusion reported by some people.

It describes some of the arguments about GNS that were raised, and describes how GNS fits into the broader ‘Big Model’ of Forge theory as ‘Creative Agenda’ (CA) that functioned as potential orienting principles for a given play group. It presents the Big Model as a kind of frame-analytic approach to understanding the structure of TRPG activity, and suggests that within such an approach, CA serve the useful purpose of allowing that activity to be understood as play. It also discusses the experience of Forge participants in grappling with the Big Model.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 03:57:57","2021-05-08 01:42:23","123-175","","","","","","Forge Theory","Palgrave Games in Context","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-52819-5_4","","","","_rpg theory; _the forge; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","White, William J.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet there has been little attention devoted to the meaningful ways RPGs have shaped society at large over the last four decades. RPGs were influential on video game design and have been widely represented in film, television and other media. They have made their mark on other areas of society, as well, including education, social media, corporate training and the military. This collection of new essays illustrates the broad appeal and impact of RPGs. Topics range from a critical reexamination of the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, to the growing significance of RPGs in education, to the potential for ""serious"" RPGs to provoke awareness and social change. The contributors discuss the myriad subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways in which the values, concepts and mechanics of RPGs have infiltrated popular culture.","2016","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2016-07-13 13:19:25","","320","","","","","The Role-Playing Society","","","","","McFarland","Jefferson, NC","en","","","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_major publication; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding requires knowledge. Finding knowledge involves digging into the murky material and getting your hands dirty. Finding understanding requires the will to dissect your own knowledge.  Nearly all writers on larp are avid larpers them selves. This makes the process of finding understanding a lot more difficult than most people outside the field would think. Larp can at its best be intensely emotional and inspirational, even a defining element of ones life. At its worst larp’s just boring. Getting to understand larp demands that the writer is willing to cast aside the fondness they feel for their subject, to evaluate the failures and boring bits. You cannot dissect without taking your subject apart. This is the dissection, here are their findings. This is the third collection of articles for Knutepunkt, the annual Scandinavian Congress on Larp. It is our hope that this book will establish a tradition of an annual book compromising articles on larp. The two former works, As Larp Grows Up, and Beyond Role and Play set the standard for us. Hopefully, we have not put them to shame.","2005","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-09-21 16:01:53","","248","","","","","","","","","","","Knutepunkt","Oslo","","","","","","","","","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Appuyée d’une enquête qualitative par questionnaires conduite sur les réseaux sociaux du Québec, cette recherche confirme une opinion favorable et un virage déjà amorcé vers l’incorporation de périphériques et de logiciels autour de la table de jeu de rôle. Seuls le jeu distanciel et les tables virtuelles font moins consensus, eux qui amenuisent le contact humain et le rapport à l’objet tangible, ou qui rapprochent le jeu de rôle sur table un peu trop près du jeu vidéo.    Ce mémoire analyse les tensions entre jeu et récit à l’intérieur de l’écosystème social et observe comment ces systèmes expérientiels interdépendants sont affectés par le choix et la manipulation des dispositifs technologiques qui sont introduits. Il place le designer industriel orienté vers l’utilisateur comme un maître de jeu 2.0 qui se sert de l’objet numérique pour se rapprocher de l’humain.   Pen and paper roleplaying is more than forty years old and it undertakes its first technological revolution only now. Building on a qualitative survey conducted over Québec social media, this research confirms a shift toward using digital hardware and software in roleplaying games and a positive opinion in general about them. Only long distance play sessions with virtual tabletops garner less extensive agreement, where human contact and emotional relationship with dice and miniatures are hampered, or because they bring tabletop roleplaying too closely to video games.    This master’s degree thesis investigates the tension between game and story inside a social ecosystem and observes how interlinked experiential systems are affected by choosing technological devices. It situates the user-centered industrial designer as a game master 2.0 that wields digital objects to get closer to human players.","2017","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-08-23 12:53:30","2018-05-22 18:36:07","","156","","","","","La remédiation du jeu de rôle sur table vers les plateformes virtuelles","","","","","Université de Montréal","Montréal, QC","en","","Mémoire de maîtrise en Design","","","papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca","","Sous la direction de Louis-Martin Guay et Pierre De Coninck","","","","_major publication; _virtual table; _actual play; _canada; _layout; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =french; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Après une rapide présentation de ces deux mondes fictionnels, il se livre dans un premier temps à l’étude des évolutions de l’imaginaire informatique constatées entre les différentes éditions de ces jeux afin de souligner deux idées importantes : la révolution que constitue un monde informatique sans fil et le paradoxe entre une démocratisation et une complexification de l’informatique. Dans un second temps, il s’efforce de dégager les grandes permanences de cet imaginaire informatique en montrant qu’il se cristallise autour des notions de capitalisme, de puissance, de violence et d’une étrange similitude entre magie et informatique., This paper aims to study how computer imaginary evolved from the end of the eighties until our days. To achieve this, we’ll scrutinize two famous cyberpunk pen and paper role playing game’s fictional worlds : Cyberpunk and Shadowrun. After a short description of those fictional worlds, we’ll study how computer imaginary evolved through the many editions of those RPG to emphasize two main ideas : the revolution of wireless hardware and the paradoxical democratization and complexity of computers. After which, we’ll show the permanence and consistency of some notions and representations : how computers are linked to capitalism and the idea of power or violence, and how computers are often related to the idea of magic.","2017","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-20 02:41:47","2018-01-30 15:58:08","","","10","","","","Jouer dans un monde informatisé","","","","","","","fr","","","","","journals.openedition.org","","Number: 10 QID: Q114772292","","","https://doi.org/10.4000/resf.1089","_literature; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =french; =biblio:DNDP2018; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This literature review will streamline the discourse surrounding games, simulation, drama, and role-playing with the recent development of edu-larp, emphasizing the various cognitive, affective, and behavioral benefits detailed in the research. The review will also discuss the challenges faced by edu-larp designers and instructors, offering possible solutions.","2014","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-03 16:44:52","2015-09-21 19:41:30","112-131","","","","","","","","","","","Wyrd Con","Los Angeles, CA","en","","","","","","","QID: Q113460378","","","","_major publication; _therapy; =blogged; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =edularp:bowman2014; =PM-lu; _LARP; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Bowman, Sarah Lynne","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of this paper is to inform players, designers, and critics about the nature of psychological triggers, how they arise and function in a larp, and what makes them an important issue for larping communities. Larps can contain triggering content; a trigger reaction is a powerful response that affects individuals, communities, and the games they play. Lastly, this article considers steps that can help prepare and care for those who experience a triggering reaction at a game event.","2014","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2019-08-23 12:29:20","","","","","","","Pulling the Trigger on Player Agency","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.academia.edu","","","","","","_agency; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In that case, the philosophers should expect the relationship between game designer and player to map onto the familiar relationship between artist and audience. Designers hoped to create mechanics that would support collaborative storytelling, player creativity, and narrative improvisation. And the improvisations are still constrained by the rules – since players still have to follow the rules and roll for their various attempts inside the flashbacks. Those rolls create quite a bit of emergent chaos, which conditions further creativity. Players are playing to find out, to discover, how history goes – and they find those answers in their own collaborative improvisation, as guided by the directive to fit it into the bits of history that they have already previously improvised. Player-centric games typically create enormous room for player agency and creativity, and encourage rich improvisations as part of play.","2021","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-15 04:01:43","","685-698","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","New York","en","","","","","","","DOI:10.4324/9781003179443-53 QID: Q113471597","","","","_major publication; _creativity; _agency; _authorship; _typology; _storygame; _improvisation; _collaborative; _TTRPG; _pbta; _art; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; =PM-lu; _OTHER GAMES; _PSYCHOLOGY; _encyclopedia; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From the traditional pen-and-paper form, that originated with Dungeons and Dragons, with a group of friends playing around a table, to large live-action game, with hundreds of people acting out their assumed roles. The first computer role-playing games appeared over twenty-five years ago and massively multi-player role-playing games, such as World of Warcraft are now one of the most popular genres of digital games. Despite this diversity players at least seem to think they know when something is a role-playing game. When players, writers and game designers say “this is a role-playing game” there are no problems, they all seem to know what each other means, what is and is not a role-playing game. Yet there is no commonly accepted definition of the form. Understandable, perhaps, given the diversity, but the implicit agreement about its use means that there may well be some common underlying features shared by the various examples. Hampering any attempt to understand what makes a game a role-playing game is the subtle divide between role-playing and role-playing game. Role-playing can take in many places, not all of them games (such as ritual, social activities, therapy, etc). This means that definitions of the role-playing activity are not that useful in separating role-playing games from other games. In this paper we start from the position that the players are correct: they know what a role-playing game is. By examining a range of roleplaying games some common features of them emerge. This results in a definition that is more successful than previous ones at identifying both what is, and what is not, a role-playing game.","2009","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:26","2015-05-13 17:55:10","3–21","","1","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107453600","","","","_therapy; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; =PM; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, there are few clear definitions of ‘world’ as it applies to commercial computer games, or as it could be used to help improvements these games. With that in mind, this paper will explore a framework for defining virtual worlds and then apply it to Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (Figure 1) in terms of phenomenological, social, and cultural aspects. Even though it is a single player game, several key features allow Oblivion to be considered as a social world. Despite these promising features, Oblivion fails as a rich cultural world. It could be further improved as a social world and perhaps even as a cultural world through various techniques.","2009","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-03-05 20:44:03","2015-05-13 17:56:05","37-52","","1","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 1","","","","_peer reviewed; _roleplay; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We seek to address that disconnection by studying relative levels of fulfillment and frequency of tabletop and online role-playing for World of Warcraft (WoW) subscribers. Finally, demographic information taken from the players themselves aids in guiding future research about which type of role-play gamers are more likely to participate in and find fulfilling. By looking at the age, location, and gender of players the relative merits of each type of role-playing is discussed, pointing to strategies to capitalize on the strengths and minimize the failings of each venue for role-playing. This study aids both the online and offline gaming industry in better understanding their target role-playing audiences, while providing a grounded study of avid role-players to support.","2009","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:41:42","2015-05-13 17:58:55","53–65","","1","","","","Seeking fulfillment","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","QID: Q107457170","","","","_fandom; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In other words, it presents one view on how a role-playing situation can be seen as a set of texts. That view also includes the idea of not only analyzing those texts, but also addressing the way game participants interpret those texts. On the side of role-playing theory, this article uses material from various schools of thought, from the post-Forge community to Nordic larp theory. On the side of hermeneutics, emphasis is on Paul Ricoeur’s idea of meaningful actions as texts. Those are the texts that people performing or observing that activity appropriate and interpret. The result of this article is one potential bridge between various schools of thought on looking at roleplaying, including a translation platform capable of enabling the move of theories and research results from one role-playing culture to the next.","2009","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-16 16:24:43","2015-05-13 17:59:04","66-78","","1","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107457146","","","","_philosophy; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finding a definition that suits them all is hard, but attempts have been many. All of the definitions emphasize some aspects of role-playing games like rules, the role of players or the story. Many definitions do not describe role-playing games as such, but the activity that is role-playing. This paper looks at one of the latest attempts to define role-playing games, by Hitchens and Drachen (2009), and shows some potential problems with it. As an answer to these problems another definition is proposed, consisting of a game world, participants, shared narrative power and interaction. This definition is given only after discussing the nature of definitions in general. By drawing from the work of Wittgenstein, it is shown that definitions are by their nature bound to language in a way Wittgenstein calls language-games. Language is constantly changing, as the culture surrounding it changes. There are no final definitions for role-playing games, only definitions suited better or worse to a certain historical understanding of role-playing games. However, this does not mean that role-playing games should not be defined, as the definitions given can advance our understanding of what role-playing games are and could be. This paper takes part in the ongoing process of definition.","2011","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:06","2015-05-13 18:00:42","3-17","","2","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107453685","","","","_philosophy; _linguistics; _rpg theory; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The game is a non-traditional,  small-press “indie” game called Ganakagok designed by the author; in the game, the characters are  men and women from a quasi-Inuit culture living on an island of ice in a world lit only by starlight.  As the game begins, the imminent arrival of the Sun is announced, and game-play is about how the  people of this culture deal with the approaching dawn. In one such game, the players of three male  characters went through interesting character arcs in their interactions with each other and with female players; those arcs seemed to depict movement among different models of masculine identity. One implication of the study is that RPGs afford a fruitful site for reflecting upon ideas in discourse,  and so it is possible for role-playing to serve as an aesthetic as well as an expressive medium—as art as well as play, in other words.","2011","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:57","2015-05-13 18:00:51","18-31","","2","","","","Playing House in a World of Night","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107453665","","","","_gender; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It fathoms the extent to which role-playing games without a didactical goal still have didactical potential, as well as the extent to which this potential is being exploited. Along the lines of the concept of surplus reality, I specifically look into the subject of the role-playing game’s alternative reality and demonstrate that the didactical potential of methodically applied role-playing can only unfold by means of the generation of an isomorphous model of a real subject matter. It can then be shown that recreational live role-playing indeed has an enormous didactical potential, just like the methodically applied kind. This potential unfolds just like in methodically applied role-playing, as live role-playing generates an isomorphous model of our reality. On the basis of these explanations I conclude with the development of a process-oriented definition of immersion, which allows for an intermediary perspective on the phenomenon of immersion, instead of a purely subjective one.","2011","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-09-21 16:02:15","2015-05-13 18:01:00","32–43","","2","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107457159","","","","_immersion; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =0.66; =cleaned; =edularp:bowman2014; _LARP; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tuomas","Sadomasochist Role-Playing as Live-Action Role-Playing: A Trait-Descriptive Analysis","International Journal of Role-Playing","","","","http://www.ijrp.subcultures.nl/wp-content/issue2/IJRPissue2-Article5.pdf","This article describes sadomasochist role-playing which is physically performed by its participants. All sadomasochist activities have a role-playing component to them. It is a form of role-playing where people consensually take on dominant and submissive roles, for the purpose of inflicting things such as pain and humiliation, in order to create pleasure for all participants. In some cases, participants agree to emphasize those roles, or make them fetishistically attractive, by adding complexity and definitions to them, and then act them out in semi-scripted fantasy scenes. This paper examines that activity, commonly called “sadomasochistic role-play”, as opposed to the more generic “sadomasochism” of which it is only one facet. Furthermore, the article compares this form of play with live-action role-playing (larp). Its main emphasis is on the question of how closely related the two activities are. To determine this, the article examines sadomasochist role-playing as being potentially a game, the question of its goal-orientation and the issue of whether or not it contains a character in the sense of a live-action role-playing character. Based on this process, it comes to the conclusion that sadomasochist role-playing is not a separate type of role-playing, but rather one kind of live-action role-playing. As its theoretical framework, this text utilizes studies done on both live-action role-playing games and on sadomasochist role-playing. Reliable material on the latter being quite limited, descriptions have been gathered from both academic works and practical manuals. The data gained from these is further supported by interviews of practitioners with personal experience in playing sadomasochist fantasy scenes.

This paper aims to investigate this existing research into the individual differences in those who play role-playing games and provide a comprehensive review of research in the areas of demographics, interests, personality and identity as they pertain to gamers. The goal will be to investigate the extent to which the common perception of game-players stands up under investigation. The paper will also attempt to refute some of the more extreme and outrageous claims which have been made in relation to role-playing games – particularly those which involve crime, violence, murders, suicides and Satanism. The article will also examine child’s play and role-playing games in order to illustrate the importance of this style of imaginary play for identity development for both children and adults. The stereotypical image of role-playing gamers depicts them as anti-social male teenagers who are largely more interested in technology than in their own personal appearance, believing that they are highly intelligent and imaginative, passionate about topics which are uninteresting to their peers, and consequently persecuted by some of these peers. Through an examination of the research carried out in this area, the emerging image of a gamer is in fact that of an individual who does not necessarily fit into the stereotypical demographic of being a young male, and who is actively involved in developing his or her own personality and identity through participation in the games and also within the social networks that are often framed by these games.","2011","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-16 16:29:11","2015-05-13 18:01:40","44-58","","2","","","","Sadomasochist role-playing as live-action role-playing","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107457183","","","","_personality; _identity; _fandom; _moral panic; _stereotype; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM-obsidianized; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It looks at three very different games played by six roleplaying ensembles, and uses interviews and group discussions to make the players reflect on how they are influenced by the rules used during play. While the sometimes insular nature of TRPG gaming became evident, it was also clear that there are several different phenomena that occur in a TRPG that can be labeled as “creative”. Aiming to provide a tool for discussion on TRPGs, six different types of creativity is outlined in the article, as well as a number of different examples of the role that the rules play in influencing these.","2012","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:13","2015-05-13 18:04:40","4-17","","3","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107453694","","","","_major publication; _creativity; _mechanics; series:gygax-actuarial-quantified-self; _players take control; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Embodied cognition theories assume that cognition is not only a feature of the brain, but the body as a whole and it is interaction with the environment it operates in. Grounded cognition proposes that an action, perceiving an action, and thinking about an action rely on the same processes. Moreover, knowledge is inseparably grounded to bodily states and modalities. Based on the grounded cognition theory and especially embodiment, we argue the character immersion and bleed are natural consequences on how the brain works. Also we illustrate how the operation of simulators explains some of the central features in the creation of fiction and it is similarities to our everyday experiences. In general, grounded cognition provides a rather simple explanation how fiction is experienced as in this theoretical framework action and thinking about an action largely utilize the same brain mechanics and so are phenomenally similar.","2012","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-05 20:36:15","2015-05-13 18:05:50","18–32","","3","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","QID: Q107457149","","","","_immersion; _bleed; _embodiment; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We examine three examples of interaction in live action roleplaying games. In all three, players rely on shared cultural knowledge. In the first example, two players employ the cultural conventions about the meanings of colors, objects and space as well as materials borrowed from myth and folklore in order to enact an encounter between a mage and a dragon. In the second, the organizers enact scenes from literary classics in order to construct the game plot.

Indeed, in their traditional form all they require is the physical presence of a group of players – commonly around a table, hence “tabletop” – who collaboratively participate in developing a narrative; and a system of rules which allow resolving the outcome of situations in which different levels of chance may be involved – the need to write down statistic information making them “pen and paper”. Evidently, this apparent lack of sophistication makes role-playing games – as a clearly contemporary cultural phenomenon (cf. Punday, 2005; Nephew, 2004; Harrigan, 2007; Mackay, 2001) – stand out in the context of a world that is becoming ever more dependent on technology. All the more so, considering the persistence of TRPGs in the face of its “descendants” in other more technologically advanced media and despite what has become the popular notion of “the bigger, the faster, the better.” Nevertheless, that which occurs during a role-playing game session – the level of interactivity, player immersion in the narrative, flexibility of the rules, etc. - generally surpasses, even today, what many of its “successors” achieve. How does this occur? How is it possible; through what mechanisms do TRPGs allow such sophistication when relying solely on the “old fashioned” technologies of (hand-) writing and oral narration? Approaching these questions from the general perspective of literary studies, the following paper problematizes what can be called a “naïve view” of communication technology by addressing the complex relationship between the printed texts used for role-playing – such as rule- and sourcebooks – and the narratives created during game-play. To do so, it addresses the fundamental influence that framings, such as rules, character sheets and setting, as well as paratextual elements contained within or at the borders of these texts, such as cover illustrations, prologues and epilogues, just to name a few – have on participants’ interpretation and, most importantly, creation of TRPG narratives.","2013","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-09-26 13:31:53","2015-05-13 18:10:38","39–54","","4","","","","A closer look at the (Rule-) Books","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","qid:Q107457061","","","","_literature; _layout; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Utilizing psychometric  surveys and semi-structured interviews, the investigators  gathered data from middle school students evaluating their  development along five dimensions of learning before and after  the semester-long program: intrinsic motivation, perceived  competence, school engagement, team work, and leadership. The  study also gathered qualitative data from the 23 students in this  convenient sample group regarding their overall experiences with  the edu-larp method.    When paired with traditional pedagogy, out of these five  dimensions of student development, the investigators found that  the edu-larp intervention helped increase overall intrinsic  motivation and interest/enjoyment of science in the quantitative  data. The qualitative and quantitative findings merged to reveal  improvement in perceived competence in science. In interviews,  students demonstrated a strong belief that larp aided in the  development of all five dimensions and expressed universal  interest in learning through edu-larp in the future. Overall, the  data suggested that adding the edu-larp component to the  existing science curriculum impacted the experience of students  by increasing interest, engagement, and perceived competence in  science through game play and role enactment.","2015","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-03-05 20:43:19","2015-12-14 19:22:03","4-25","","5","","","","Educational Larp in the Middle School Classroom","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","QID: Q108027899","","","","_peer reviewed; _roleplay; =blogged; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =edularp:bowman2014; =PM-lu; _LARP; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This mixed methods study is an investigation of the  use of role-play in an undergraduate university course  designed to prepare students to become public school coaches  and physical education teachers. The five original vignettes  that were role-played were specifically written to prepare the  students to successfully handle situations they might  reasonably encounter in their future work. The role-play  model used in the research was originally created by the  Shaftels in the 1960s, but several creative variations devised  by the current investigators were added to that model for this  study causing it to be an adapted version. Data collected  included questionnaire responses from two different  questionnaires, information from a focus group, and  observations by the two investigators. Investigators concluded  that the students not only exhibited skill in the techniques  used to resolve the issues in the vignettes, but that students  gained confidence the more they participated in the role-plays  which occurred over a 4-week period. The students  themselves reported that learning from one’s peers, trying out  their ideas in a safe environment, being forced to plan an  intended outcome in advance, and hearing feedback from  others were their most valued experiences.

Ecology  and ecological, in this context, are not used to explain our relation to nature and its protection, but  rather our relationship to our surrounding environment and other subjects dwelling in it. The approach was chosen because it provides the study with a comprehensive and an inclusive way of looking at performances.  Larps can be seen as performances from many points of view: it can mean displaying one’s skills in role-playing or in improvising; it can mean patterning one’s behavior to signify that of a fictional character; or it can mean keeping up a  vision or expectations of a fictional character. In addition – and what is especially the focus of this paper – the performance of larping can be understood as completing or carrying out actions that constitute the activity called larping.  To explain the ecological approach, this paper will first provide the reader with an overview of larps as ecologies, and then dissect the performance of larping into four steps that are essentially connected to each other in the ecology: information pickup, extraction of possibilities, choice-making and embodiment.  To summarize, a larp ecology is a comprehensive interdependent systems where all the players and other organic and non-organic components of the game  support  each other. In this ecology, the players pick up information,  extract  possibilities for  actions from that information, make choices on which possibilities to carry out and embody those choices by applying their bodily repertoire to the performance.","2015","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-03-05 20:42:38","2015-12-14 19:24:05","35-46","","5","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","Number: 5","","","","_peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the purposes of understanding typical modes of engagement, immersion concepts are considered alongside player motivation theories. Furthermore, this article applies these categories, which are drawn largely from game studies, to the field of health care simulation, categorizing specific practices within the simulation classroom according to types of immersion. The goal of this research is to enhance the understanding and design of simulation by appealing to multiple modes of immersion, which may assist in engaging a greater number of students. Diversifying the types of experiences within health care simulations in order to appeal to multiple modalities of immersion holds the potential to create more rich and layered experiential learning situations..","2016","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-03-05 20:43:23","2021-08-09 20:13:50","12-19","","6","","","","Enhancing Healthcare Simulations and Beyond","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","QID:Q108027835","","","","_simulated patient; _peer reviewed; _roleplay; _medecine-nursing; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper uses a dramatistic perspective to explore the discursive dynamics of their encounter, which represented contact between role-playing game designers from different traditions that were driven by similar imperatives and goals. It establishes the context of their encounter, summarizes the video recordings that document it, and uses the “dramatistic pentad” developed by rhetorician Kenneth Burke as a tool for reading the multiple levels of narrative and interaction that emerge as each speaker presents their perspective on the development of the different communities of play for whom they speak. It identifies an important dynamic within their speech as being how orientations toward differentiation or toward integration manifest in different ways. Ultimately, the encounter between Ron Edwards and Tobias Wrigstad provides access to different ways of thinking about the relationships between role-playing communities over time and in space: as instances of differentiation or as parts of a larger dialogue.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-03-05 15:28:49","","40-55","","10","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","qid:Q107457162","","","","_publishing; _nordic larp; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One group within this complex system is live action role-players (larpers). Larps are a variant of play that combine the “role-playing” of games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, with the “live action” aspects of sports. Using symbolic interactionism as its paradigmatic orientation, this study examines how the magic circle is reinforced and challenged through the development of ingame characters and their effect on the out-of-game self. The respondents of this ethnography participate in a larp called Dagorhir (1977-), which puts an emphasis on live action combat rather than role-play. Participants are part of the Las Vegas realm of Dagorhir, Barad’Dun. Players view Dagorhir as a full contact sport mixed with martial arts; role-playing and character development is encouraged, but not necessary. I observed, interviewed, and participated with this group over the period of six months. Even in a combat-oriented larp like Dagorhir, players get to choose names, weapons, clothing, fighting techniques, and other ways to develop their in-game characters; this ability establishes a connection between leisure larps and edu-larps.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","56-69","","10","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","QID: Q112208861","","","","_peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the concepts of spillover, bleed, compensation, role conflict, and contrast, this article focuses on how such experiences can contain reversals of playful and serious motivational states. Data was obtained by interviewing nine participants from various countries: areas of subject expertise; amounts of teaching and larping experience; and levels of education (primary, secondary, tertiary, and vocational). Qualitative content analysis (Mayring 2002) was used to evaluate the guideline-structured interviews via a category system developed from a theoretical framework, combining the research findings of Fenstermacher et al. (2009), Apter (2008), Banner (1985), Biddle (1983 and 1979), Staines (1980) and Kando and Summers (1971). The results of this investigation show that all interviewees drew on their professional teaching experiences for planning and conducting play-pretend lessons at College of Wizardry.

Playing a professor at College of Wizardry with a professional background in teaching provided an opportunity to explore and experiment, due to the absence of expectations present in professional settings.

An analysis of these two classes shows a community eager to use game rule algorithms as a way to center sexuality in their play. We argue that these communities provide evidence of how the Dungeons & Dragons ruleset provided a boiler-plate for game rules that support the norms of hegemonic masculinity and have influenced the culture of toxic masculinity in game algorithms today.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:29","","10-25","","10","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","QID: Q107453663","","","","_dnd; _gender; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six young adults (3 men, 3 women) between the ages of 19 and 24 (M = 21.2, SD = 2.6) were recruited from role-playing communities within Nova Scotia, Canada. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess perceived social competence and semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect detailed qualitative data about lived experiences with role-playing games. Responses on the SDQ indicated that participants had typical strengths and difficulties with respect to social competence at the time of the current study. The qualitative description indicated the emergence of four main themes related to role-playing games from the interviews: Content Focus, Social Focus, Creativity Focus, and Identity Focus. The themes present in the interviews are consistent with findings from previous case study research, suggesting that role-playing games may have the potential to improve perceived social competence, and further elucidate the lived experiences of people who play role-playing games in terms of why they engage with tabletop role-playing games.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:40","","70-83","","10","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","QID: Q112208876","","","","_peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM; _soft skills; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a host of research discussing barriers for women and minorities in terms of full representation and interaction in gaming and “geek” spaces (Garcia 2017; Reagle 2015; Stang and Trammell 2019). I assert that one rationale for this limitation is the domination of gaming spaces by men, particularly middle-class White men, and the subculture that comes along with this demographic. Dunning (1986) discusses the concept of male preserves, how sports in particular create subcultures that prize behavior and language that are associated with men and embodied in the male form. I discuss how the TRPG table is a male preserve, encouraging a level of dominance that colors table talk and acceptable norms (Dunning, Murphy and Williams 2014). The masculine nature of the discussion style of this table talk is more difficult by subaltern groups because of the clear association with “stereotypical” gamers, commonly White and male, and this difficulty is demonstrated in various ways (Bowman 2013; Hendricks 2006; Ilieva 2013). I surmise that while diversity has always existed and proceeds to improve in tabletop gaming, the subcultural elements of a male preserve remain difficult to uproot.","2020","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","26-39","","10","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","qid:Q107457156","","","","_gender; _conversation; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _problematic; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For broader implementation, the design of the game has to serve curricular and pedagogical needs alike. This paper presents core principles of design and implementation of educational live action role-playing games in curricular primary and secondary education. Over the course of 5 years, 16 live action role-playing games with a total of 53 cycles of Design-based Research (DBR) including design, testing, and evaluation were conducted in German schools. This paper synthesizes 17 essential principles from the DBR cycles as best practice in the context of subject-bound curricular focus. The results of our study show that four parameters differ in schools from extracurricular live action role-playing activities: curricular guidelines, compulsory participation, grading practices, and time/space confinements. These four parameters need to be taken into consideration at all times when designing and conducting a live action role-playing game in a school environment. Moreover, design for simplicity and inclusion is paramount for successful implementation within subject-teaching in schools as a rewarding tool to foster content-knowledge and to promote social and personal skills.","2021","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:19","","114-131","","11","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","QID: Q112209013","","","","_gamification; _assessment; _curriculum; _yo13-19; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _yo1-12; _LARP; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Violence within the system’s 5th edition core rulebook, the Player’s Handbook (Wizards of the Coast 2014b), is analysed using textual analysis with insight from previous research on common violence motivators of heroism, hatred, and sensation-seeking curiosity. Overall, the study concludes that the D&D system facilitates playing violence, specifically through heroic motivation based on androcentric perceptions of chivalric fantasy ideals. This study also finds that the system spotlights combat over nonviolent interactions. Future research could investigate how participant agency may affect violence in similar traditional RPG systems, and why choosing violence in a no-consequence game could reflect real-world behaviours.","2021","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:00","","6-24","","11","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","QID: Q112209017","","","","_dnd; _mechanics; _minority; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using autoethnography and post-structuralist queer theory of performativity in combination with scholarly perspectives of RPGs as sites for potentially transformative experiences, I consider the ways in which live-action role-playing games (larps) might help trans people express, explore, and embody their subjectivity. I argue that despite there being a relatively small (though growing) number of larps designed to encourage players to consider gender and sexuality norms in society, there remains no larp that intentionally allows trans people (or those questioning their gender) to consider their gender subjectivity therein. Scholarly perspectives on larps suggest that they might provide a site for the simulation of complex socio-cultural dynamics, a space to adopt different social roles, and the alibi and scaffolding to do so in a way that is validating with a community of like-minded role-players (Deterding 2018; Bowman and Hugaas 2021). I present examples of larps that, either by design or not, seem to have provided opportunities for gender role-play and transformative experiences for some trans players. I consider the possible limitations the embodied experience of larps -- as opposed to digital and table-top RPGs (TRPGs) -- might have in allowing such exploration for some trans players, particularly in potentially transphobic play environments. I argue however, that the embodied nature of larps might also provide an opportunity to explore gender role-play in such a way that allows for the validation of more diverse physical and social gender presentations, as well as the rehearsal thereof in a safer space. I present accounts of trans people -- including my own autoethnography -- using role-playing games, larps, and other activities/environments not necessarily consciously designed for the purpose of gender exploration as the basis for how this might be designed for intentionally in larps. I conclude by proposing to design a larp that could provide an opportunity to express, explore, and embody non-normative gender, and I pose a series of questions that I believe such a design should seek to answer.","2021","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-03-05 20:44:00","","94-113","","11","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","QID: Q112209027","","","","_identity; _gender; _embodiment; _lgbtq; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several studies suggest that they might have an impact, but the topic of RPGs and well-being is usually only mentioned as a side note or curiosity. A clear, coherent picture on the topic of RPGs and well-being is missing. This review article aims to provide that picture by compiling the already existing knowledge in one place. I ask the questions: What can we learn from the already existing research? How should RPGs and well-being be studied? What questions need resolving? What can be gained from studying RPGs and well-being? RPG studies is a young academic interdisciplinary field of research, as is also the research of arts and well-being. They both are heterogeneous and related to a variety of academic traditions. They both are also dispersed, pragmatic, and until recently, scattered and lacking cohesive traditions or methodologies. Many basic ontological questions remain unsolved and the definitions of key concepts vary. They overlap in several discourses, such as the ones about (1) practices of sociodrama and replication therapy; (2) social, cultural, and digital capital; (3) leisure time research; (4) performance studies; (5) the topic of erotic role-play; (6) problematic vs. therapeutic gaming; and (7) health education. Previous research and practices focus mainly on live action role play (larp) and well-being, suggesting a positive impact. Online RPGs share their own traditions, but studies on tabletop RPGs and well-being are difficult to find. The studies are often case-studies or examine abstract topics such as human experiences. In these studies, it becomes evident that RPGs do indeed impact well-being. However, questions such as how, why, and what features in RPGs affect well-being remain unanswered. In addition, the research has mainly been executed from the perspective of either RPGs or arts and well-being. Interdisciplinary cooperation is the key to successfully diving into the world of RPGs and well-being. Doing so would offer both fields useful practices, interesting perspectives, new opportunities for publication and academic discussion. It would not only add knowledge about RPGs and well-being but offer perspective to the unresolved ontological questions of each field. Eventually, further study on RPGs and well-being could transfer into the usage of RPGs in the fields of well-being, health, and therapy in a similar manner that arts are currently being used.","2021","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2023-11-20 17:42:53","","72-93","","11","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","QID: Q112209021","","","","_therapy; _well-being; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _art; _sex-transgressive; =cleaned; =PM; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Players may achieve greater empathy for marginalized people (Galinsky and Moskowitz 2000; Greitemeyer and Osswald 2010) or undergo meaningful psychological change via intentional and unconscious self-exploration (Bowman 2007). However, not all of these stories have a happily ever after. This article examines the ways in which such role-play as a marginalized character can also have unintended negative consequences. We relate this larp activity to the phenomenon of dark tourism, in which privileged individuals voluntarily enter disaster zones due to a mix of motives that include voyeurism and vicarious danger exposure, carrying with them a mixed bag of intentions and outcomes. This review aims to answer the following question: What are the positive and negative outcomes of role-playing as a marginalized character? We will explore individual and collective outcomes of this type of experiential learning and make recommendations for designers and players to better achieve desired positive outcomes and limit the negative ones. Our work draws on research from games studies, experimental psychology, pedagogical studies, and the emerging literature about the motivations and consequences of tourism that seeks to touch on pain, trauma, and even death (i.e., dark tourism).","2021","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2024-03-05 20:43:50","","25-47","","11","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","QID: Q112209009","","","","_mental disorder; _minority; _refugee; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The “Drachenfest” as a unique and challenging environment called for the implementation of something not yet described in earlier research about social safety. This paper will detail the implementation of a social safety team as a best practice example. It will consider questions of how to put such a team together and how to write an accompanying code of conduct. The paper also describes standard procedures for the work of such a team.

"UN8TH352","journalArticle","2020","White, William J.","The Discourse of Player Safety in the Forge Diaspora, 2003-2013:","RPG学研究: Japanese Journal of Analog Role-Playing Game Studies","","2434-9682","10.14989/jarps_1_35","https://jarps.net/journal/article/view/14","The idea of player safety – a concern for the psychological well-being of the people who play role-playing games on the part of those who design and run those games – has within the past several years emerged as a rubric for a whole host of pre-game, in-game, and post-game procedures intended to address that concern, particularly in larp but in tabletop RPGs as well. However, considerations of player safety sometimes produce skeptical responses on the part of those who fear, for instance, that player safety mechanisms will somehow dilute the experience or stifle their creativity. Examining the dynamics of conversations produced by these countervailing concerns can provide insight into the nature of RPG participation. A full understanding of these dynamics, however, will benefit from an investigation of the historical underpinnings of the discourse of player safety. To that end, this essay explores conversations around safety-related discourse within the online sphere known as the “Forge Diaspora.” The Forge was an online discussion site for tabletop RPG design, publication, and play that was active in the first decade of the twenty-first century, serving to champion creator-owned “indie RPGs” and game design innovation during that period. In addition, it inspired a panoply of blogs and forums where further discussion took place. Among the considerations related to player safety discussed within the Forge Diaspora were the tools Ron Edwards called Lines and Veils and Meguey Baker’s complementary principles of Nobody Gets Hurt and I Will Not Abandon You. This essay uses techniques of rhetorical analysis to reconstruct frameworks of narrative and argumentation about these and related ideas with the goal of providing historical context for contemporaneous conversations about player safety.","2020-09-21","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-17 02:54:50","2021-12-20 16:22:28","35-47","","1","","","","The Discourse of Player Safety in the Forge Diaspora, 2003-2013","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2020 The Author(s)","","","","jarps.net","","Number: 1 QID: Q114713298","","","","_safe space; _well-being; _the forge; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","rhetorical approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These games often use the medium as a diegetic space and are written with the assumption that both the players and the characters are interacting remotely; the characters communicate through video calls, radio signals or text messages to match the distributed nature of the players. However, a number of online larps do not employ this strategy and instead have the players operating remotely while the characters are in the same location. This article explores the challenges and possibilities of creating online, immersive games where there is dissonance between medium and activity and how games can retain immersion and embodiment.

However, in the fiscal year 2020, university libraries had to be closed due to the influence of preventing the spread of the new coronavirus. Under these circumstances, many university libraries attempted to provide library guidance online. In the same way, the author’s research team tried to create a library guidance “Libardry Form” which does not rely on any paid tools or special skills. Based on the research team’s prior experiences with game-type library guidance, we conducted an exploratory study to understand the game’s impact on library learning. Concretely, for a trial survey of the features of the “Libardry Form” we recruited eleven university students during classes taught by the first author and thirty-one participants from the general public via SNS. After playing the game, we asked the participants to fill out a questionnaire. Thirty-three respondents (78.6%) preferred our game-type library guidance to the more common video-type guidance. We also asked the eleven university students who experienced the game to cooperate with us for additional pre- and post-surveys and analyzed the results of the eight valid responses we received. We found that it was difficult to recognize the influence of the “Libardry Form” on sophomore and junior students who had used university libraries before. Contrastingly, although it is not possible to generalize the results due to the small number of valid responses, the results indicate that the “Libardry Form” may improve the understanding of freshmen who have little experience using university libraries.","2021-12-20","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-17 02:54:50","2021-12-20 16:16:42","12-21","","2","","","","Creation and Implementation of a Game-Type Library Guidance Conducted Online","","","","","","","ja","Copyright (c) 2021","","","","jarps.net","","Number: 2 QID: Q114713316","","","","_gamification; _information literacy; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _LIBRARY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, the survey results point to limitations of the current version of the scenario but also implied essential factors for developing and managing CoC TRPG scenarios and sessions for peace educational purposes. First, for effective sessions, the scenario needs to incorporate the main theme intelligibly for players. Second, letting players think about how their characters perceive social issues may help players rethink their views and contribute to raising awareness of an issue.

Rather than simply functioning as digital equivalents of paper character records, keepers serve as shared sheets, allowing all players to refer to the information on all player characters simultaneously; take advantage of the programming interface of Google Sheets to provide automated functions like drop-down selections for character options or real time calculation of stats; often include tabs for tracking shared session and campaign notes as well as scenario and game state information for the GM; include a lot of the reference information needed to play the game; integrate supplementary safety tools that facilitate play; and provide links to other accessories used during online play like digital dice rollers or additional visualization tools. &nbsp; In discussing character keepers, we outline their characteristics and the pragmatics of their use, followed by elements of a short history of this format, a description of some historical and contemporary examples, a systematic exploration of contemporary player and designer theorizing on this topic, and an attempt at locating our examination of character keepers within the broader context of (role-playing) game studies: participation and co-creation, platform studies, and an aesthetics of indie TRPGs.","2021-12-20","2022-09-21 16:01:53","2022-10-17 03:00:00","2021-12-20 16:17:17","31-50","","2","","","","Beyond the Character Sheet","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2021 Adrian Hermann, Gerrit Reininghaus","","","","jarps.net","","Number: 2 QID: Q114713167","","","","_publishing; _character sheet; _the forge; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","play aids","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research, we reached out to an expert community of crafters of social experiences: larpers (live action role players). Larpers and larp designers have a longstanding tradition of designing and making use of a variety of elements, such as costumes, physical objects, environments, and recently also digital artifacts. These are crafted in support of co-experience values that we argue can inform the design of social wearables. We engaged in a co-design process with a game designer and co-founder of a larp production company, and embedded the resulting social wearables in a larp. Here, we present the results of this design and implementation process, and articulate design affordances that resonate with our larp designer' values.

En effet, ce mouvement d’abord américain a fait une entrée remarquée dans l’espace public qui incite à s’interroger sur sa réalité sociologique. Les geeks sont abordés ici comme fans de mondes imaginaires fantastiques (science-fiction, fantasy…), passionnés de nouvelles technologies et en tant que public premier et fondateur du processus de convergence culturelle théorisé par Henry Jenkins. La montée en visibilité du phénomène geek est ainsi liée dans cette étude à celle de pratiques médiatiques associées à ce processus (fanfictions, démocratisation des outils numériques, œuvres transmédiatiques et immersives, etc.). Dans ce cadre, le tournant réflexif (vers un sentiment d’appartenance à une identité collective) et la mode médiatique autour de la culture geek ces dernières années trouvent leurs racines dans les moments fondateurs de la convergence culturelle (depuis les pulps fictions et la naissance des comic books jusqu’à la sortie de Star Wars, du Seigneur des anneaux, des premiers jeux de rôles et jeux vidéo). Mais cela doit aussi à la radicalisation récente des croisements médiatiques, des pratiques participatives, de la mondialisation des partages liée aux technologies numériques et au passage des identités prescrites aux identités choisies dans les sociétés contemporaines marquées par l’individualisme.","2012-12-11","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2015-05-01 20:40:26","","","","","","","La construction sociale d'une sous-culture","","","","","Université Lyon 3","Lyon","","","Doctorat Sciences de l'information et de la communication","","","www.theses.fr","","","","","","_fandom; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =french; _LARP; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our analysis of this film, we explore leadership behaviours in an extreme context – a zombie apocalypse where survivors face persistent existential threat. Extreme context research presents methodological challenges, particularly with regard to fieldwork. The use of films as proxy case studies is one way in which to overcome these problems, and for researchers working in an interpretivist perspective, 'social science fiction' is increasingly used as a source of inspiration and ideas. The contribution of our analysis concerns highlighting the role of leadership configurations in extreme contexts, an approach not previously addressed in this field, but one that has greater explanatory power than current perspectives. In Day of the Dead, we observe several different configurations – patterns of leadership styles and behaviours – emerging, shifting and overlapping across the phases of the narrative, each with radically different consequences for the group of survivors. These observations suggest a speculative theory of leadership configurations and their implications in extreme contexts, for exploring further, with other methods.","2019-04","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2019-05-09 17:41:10","152-170","","2","50","","","Surviving a zombie apocalypse","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","","","_leadership; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It seems increasingly difficult to build meaningful educational experiences able to involve young people in transformative processes and overcome the ingrained ""nihilistic sense"". The new digital paradigm and the evolving perceptions of corporeal forms bring some crucial changes we need to explore. The social science teachings need, therefore, to be renewed to better deal with knowledge and skills in an interactive environment, promoting creativity, aesthetics, global and critical thinking and to promote relevant societal change. A possible educational method to tackle these realities can be given by the Educational Live Action Role Play (hereafter ""Edu-larp""). An Edu-larp is a live role-playing game in which the narration is not only told but also played in first hand by the participants with their body and their actions. Players interact each other by interpreting a character and playing fictitious situations in a real space (""magic circle""). Despite the Edu-larp still being a growth method, several studies are highlighting its specific benefits, which include: identity exploration, communities building and cooperation, transversal skills, didactic media, problem solving, empathy, and self-awareness. The presented study builds on the findings of an experimental research on two migration-themed Edu-larps: ""Youth On The Run"" which simulates the migratory journey of an asylum seeker family from Somalia to Italy for 24 hours; and ""300, the battle of the tent cities"" which simulates a 4-hour municipal meeting in which the participants have to decide the placement of 300 refugees arriving in their city. It aims to enquire whether both games have significant effects on the participants' empathy and ethnic prejudices. The research was conducted on 82 subjects who partook an Edu-larp, using an open-question survey, psychometric scales and Implicit Association Test (IAT). The test was iterated three times: one week before, one week after and three months after the game. This paper will present the research design, the first reflections on the relationship between a ""game for social change"", and possible Edu-larp paths in future of education.","2019","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","455–462","","","","","","Edu-larp Paths in Education","","","","","Filodiritto Publisher","Bologna","en","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000494943300079","","","","_attitude change; _empathy; _bias; _minority; _roleplay; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","Empathy; Educational   Research; Ethnic Prejudice; Game for Social Change; Intercultural Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

LARP is separated from the mundane world by the “magic circle”, created by explicit rules and the social contract. In game, players strive for immersion, similar to the concept of flow, in which players feel that they are their characters. This immersion is enabled by character performance, a fully sensorial atmosphere, and personal relationships between the characters. Once immersed, players no longer feel as if they are acting, but rather that the character has taken over. This immersion allowed players to enter the Enchanted State and an alternate reality in which characters are performative and actions within game were referred to as authentic. This adult play allows players to construct a fragile alternate reality based on the belief of its players.","2013-07-17","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2016-04-04 18:06:30","","","","","","","When Seeing is Believing","","","","","Utrecht University","Utrecht","en","","MS Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences","","","","","","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, it contributes to the understanding of costumes as collaborators in a larp network. Second, it shows that the change towards a network perspective expands the understanding of games as relational processes. An actor-network analysis of the costume builds on first-hand data from three larps. Data analysis required a set of qualitative methods based upon participatory observation and qualitative interviews. The results of the analysis are: 1. Larp works, because the costume contributes to role playing. 2. The costume contributes when it changes its arrangement of material actors to fulfill the demands of the network. 3. Costume contribution demands changes from narrative and ludic actors as well and the result of these negotiations is a development of the network. 4. The development of the three observed larp networks resulted in costumes that work towards the 360° illusion ideal, change game rules, and raise the popularity of one favored narrative genre: Fantasy. Following the costume and tracing its work, reveals how larp as a network of heterogeneous actors structures itself. These processes become visible with an actor-network perspective that reaches beyond the division of agency as being driven by human or material actors.","2015","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DiGRA '15 - Proceedings of the 2015 DiGRA International Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These tensions are a product of a combination of the history of roleplaying games and other Live-Action simulative activities, the specific logistical and historical circumstances of the MIT Assassins’ Guild and the expectations of the members of the MIT Assassins’ Guild. Game designers and players frequently cite case studies and have developed a useful vocabulary that are worth learning to facilitate further discussion of game design. Guild game mechanics are designed for feasibility of implementation and execution by the game designers and the players, to provide and hide information from players in a timely manner, to dissociate player decisions from character actions, to enhance the verisimilitude and the atmosphere of the game for the players, and to generate, balance and resolve interesting competition among players. Experienced game designers keep all these tensions in mind while designing mechanics that can satisfy all the criteria and highlight desirable traits that arise from the interplay of the tensions.","2003","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","146","","","","","","","","","","MIT","Cambridge, MA","en","","MS Comparative Media Studies","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"5Z269VPG","conferencePaper","2005","Lindley, Craig A.; Eladhari, Mirjam","Narrative Structure in Trans-Reality Role-Playing Games: Integrating Story Construction from Live Action, Table Top and Computer-Based Role-Playing Games","Proceedings of DiGRA 2005 Conference","","","","http://summit.sfu.ca/item/225","Trans-reality games are games combining virtual gaming with game experiences staged and played in physical environments. Mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive gaming technologies provide a facilitating infrastructure for trans-reality games. The technical infrastructure must integrate physical game elements with virtual game elements, ideally allowing game play and components to move as ""seamlessly"" as possible through these spaces as parts of a single coherent game world. This means the preservation of the sense of identity of game objects through their manifestation in different physical and virtual realities, the propagation of the significance of game actions and events through these realities, and game mechanics that weave those events into a coherent game concept. The development of design principles and methodologies for trans-reality games requires a model of the relationships between the functional roles of players and technologies, how these vary with different game staging and scenarios, and how these variations can be integrated within games that involve different modes of physical, virtual and mixed reality game play. In the case of trans-reality role-playing games (TRRPGs) these questions extend to issues of characterization and story construction. The concept of a TRRPG extends and evolves existing role-playing game (RPG) forms including table-top (TTRPG), live-action (LARP), computer-based, and especially massively multiplayer on-line (MMORPG), RPGs. A game system consisting of core rules and basic models for such things as characters and objects, their features and capabilities, combat, economics and trading, can often be used across all of these different contexts. However, despite this trans-mediality of the game system, the experience of characterization and narrative depth among different RPG forms is fundamentally different, largely due to radically different modes of story construction among the different forms. Previous work has analysed the relationships between simulation, game play and narrativity in computer games (see Aarseth, 1997, Frasca, 2001, and Lindley, 2003). These distinctions can be generalized into a model of the structure of all RPG forms, including table-top and live-action RPGs. The simulation level generalizes to a simulation/realization level providing a world within which game and story experiences take place. The game world may be realized with a literal representation (the game space stands for itself), synthetic or fictional representation (the world is realized symbolically), or some hybrid of literal and synthetic elements. The simulation level also includes foundations for realizing a range of possible literal or symbolic actions. This is the lowest level of temporal design in a ludic system upon which is superimposed a game level that includes rules specifying actions constituting valid game moves together with objectives for players to achieve by the performance of game moves. The time structure of each move requires a higher level of design than the simulation/realization level. However, the potential for players to choose moves results in a very loosely predefined time structure above the level of moves within the design of a game. Above the level of game moves, narrative is perceived when an experience in time has an overall shape conforming to a specific narrative pattern, such as the three-act restorative structure. This is the highest level of predefined time structure. In general a narrative is a representation of events. In computer games this often has the form of a filmic story told by cut scenes and framing the play experience (performance of moves) at a high level. Structural theories of textual and verbal narrative posit a generative substrate (a cultural space of possible stories) underlying the diegesis or specific objects and events of a particular narrative. The diegesis and its events constitute a story. The selection and presentation of elements of the story, with expressive variations of emphasis, constitute a plot. The plot is expressed in an act of telling, ie. a particular narrative. The available text is the narrative, while the other layers of meaning are inferred from the text and its relationship with other texts. Considering narrative construction and encoding within RPGs reveals very different relationships to this model. A TTRPG may be based upon published game worlds, scenarios and systems including elements of classic textual narrative. This provides the foundation for a game master and group of players to improvise a new (primarily verbal) narrative through the unfolding play sessions of a TTRPG campaign. Improvisation involves assembling sequences of fictive blocks, basic fragments or units of fictional/narrative significance that may be strung together to form a higher level narrative (Mackay, 2001). The fictive blocks include moves and text provided by the game system together with those drawn from the players’ imaginations and experiences. A computer-based MMORPG, however, provides players with a finite and fixed set of possible moves, together with the media foundation for realising moves as audiovisual and simulation events. Hence the MMORPG player generally chooses from predefined fictive blocks, supplemented by textual interaction with other players via chat facilities. This is a severely constrained improvisational freedom compared with the other RPG forms; the computer RPG removes much of the space for individual interpretation and imaginative elaboration by providing very explicit visualisations together with very limited options for improvisation. Collaborative story formation in LARPs is different again. While a TTRPG collaboratively produces a collective text upon which individual acts of imagination build, a LARP consists of a kind of performative multitext; there is no central social representation (or narrative), and there is a different story for each player, none occupying a privileged position as keeper of a primary story. The LARP setting may vary in its diegetic freedom between that of a MMORPG and that of a TTRPG, depending upon the literalness of representation of its setting, costumes, props and performances. LARP performances have the full advantage of all avenues of direct, face-to-face human communication, leading to the possibility of the highest levels of immersive and emotional experience. A trans-reality RPG (TRRPG) must integrate the different narrative modalities of RPG forms into a coherent overall system. This requires a careful mapping of player roles and technical mechanisms onto narrative functions in ways that preserve or enhance the strengths of the different play modalities involved, and ideally feed the results of play from their strong modalities into the other modes to enrich the overall TRRPG experience.","2005","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-30 19:10:57","2015-05-14 14:25:13","1-9","","","","","","Narrative Structure in Trans-Reality Role-Playing Games","","","","","DiGRA","Vancouver, BC","","","","","","summit.sfu.ca","","REFERENCES Aarseth E.

To our knowledge, even quantitative instruments for in situ measuring (i.e. during playing the game) of affective constructs, for instance flow or generalized positive and negative affect in edu-LARPs, are lacking. Existing instruments cannot be applied straightforwardly due to several reasons; most notably, because they are not gamified. Administering a non-gamified inventory in the game can influence/interrupt the states it is supposed to measure. The research aim of our new project is to investigate acquisition of mental models of mechanical devices learnt within an edu-LARP and correlate the quality of the acquired mental model with in situ flow and generalized positive/negative affect (planned N (similar to) 10 groups x 10 participants). So far, we have conducted three pilots (N = 10, 12, 13) for which we developed a new method for assessing these constructs by in-game questionnaires (and tested the LARP's plot, a sci-fi space opera). The results so far are promising in that we are able to administer the respective questionnaires in situ without adverse effects of the measurement process on these states; as reported by participants in post hoc focus groups. Our method can be probably used in other edu-LARPs provided certain requirements on the LARP's plot are met. Another result is that some components of flow (such as fluency/sense of control) seem to be influenced by role playing but others (such as absorption or time alteration) not so. This indicates that the notion of flow as a unitary construct may not be applicable in LARP contexts.","2015","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","767-769","","","","","","Towards in Situ Measurement of Affective Variables During Playing Educational LARPs","","","","","Acad Conferences Ltd","Nr Reading","en","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000371976400094","","","","=cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _LARP; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY","flow; positive affect","Munkvold, R.; Kolas, L.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The work explores LARP as a practice, formed by this community. Though the practice evolves over time, this work shows some of the common structures evident in LARP practice considered good by the Intercon LARP community. The analysis of this ethnographic work shows commonalities with other forms of role play, including the history of social simulations used in formal and informal learning environments, theater, reenactment communities, and various role playing games. In addition to description and historical context, this work explores some of the structures evident in this community's LARP practice that set this practice apart as a significant form of participant production and collaborative storytelling. The work explores some of the constraints and affordances of designing, and co-designing, within this highly collaborative environment in ways that facilitate engagement with a variety of LARP participants. This exploration identifies the structure of LARP, in the abstract, as a combination of character, world, and theme, each of which are composed of story, environment, rules, and play. In this structure, play has an operational role in instantiating the other elements within LARP, turning written material, costuming, set design, and other forms of preparatory activity into reality through performance. Finally, this work explores the potential for LARP use as a tool for developing empathy, critical ethical reasoning, and various forms of content learning and technical competencies.","2011","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-06-29 15:10:43","","265","","","","","Negotiation, simulation, and shared fantasy","","","","","The University of Wisconsin - Madison","Madison, WI","en","Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2011","Ph.D. Anthropology","","","ProQuest","","","","","","=cleaned; =edularp:bowman2014; _LARP; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"B7SGYLXD","bookSection","2013","Leonard, Diana J.; Arango, Grayson","The Dynamic Life Cycle of Live Action Role-Play Communities","WyrdCon Companion Book 2013","","","","","This chapter discusses the challenges that may emerge for live action role-play (larp) communities at each inflection point of the group life cycle. According to Tuckman, groups mature over time and move through four stages: forming, norming, storming, and performing (e.g., Tuckman 1965; Tuckman and Jensen 1977). The aim of the present chapter is to discuss the ways in which the development of real larp communities fit with Tuckman’s theory and to highlight inconsistencies that may emerge, in particular due to the multiple layers that can comprise a role-playing experience (e.g., Fine 1983). Since each stage of the group life cycle is fraught with opportunities for member exit and group dissolution, we also argue that cultural practices of successful, long-standing larp communities have manifested to meet these challenges. For example, larp groups may begin a new session with a  listen-up period in which players gather in a circle to discuss the rules and clarify any misconceptions before gameplay begins. This activity mirrors the “restorative circle” that can occur before schoolyard play (Costello, Wachtel and Wachtel 2010), which likely promotes group maintenance factors such as informal leadership and procedural voice. We hope this work will have applied value for members of successful larp groups that experience “growing pains” as, for example, the group enters the storming stage characterized by unclear boundaries and fragile self-esteem of group members (Thompson and White 2010, 4). Along  with the rules and activities described by role-play scholars (e.g., Montola 2008), this chapter draws on the practices common to a specific, anonymized larp group located in the United States. The scholarly foundation for this work is grounded in various disciplines, particularly industrial/organizational and social psychology, and role-playing studies.","2013","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:06","","125-136","","","","","","","","","","","Wyrd Con","Los Angeles, CA","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","Bowman, Sarah Lynne","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recreational  role-playing includes forms such as tabletop role-playing games, larps  and online role-playing games, while pervasive games range from treasure  hunts to alternate reality games. A discussion on pervasive role-playing  connects these strands together. The work has four larger research goals. First, to establish a  conceptual framework for understanding role-playing in games. Second, to  establish a conceptual framework for understanding pervasive games.  Third, to explore the expressive potential of pervasive games through  prototypes. And fourth, to establish a theoretical foundation for the  study of ephemeral games. The central outcome of the work is a theory complex that explains and  defines role-playing and pervasive gaming, and allows them to be  understood in the context of the recent discussion in game studies. In order to understand these two borderline cases of games, the work  establishes a theoretical foundation that highlights gameplay as a  social process. This foundation combines the weak social constructionism  of John R. Searle with the recent game studies scholarship from authors  such as Jesper Juul, Jane McGonigal, Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman. Työssä etsitään vastauksia neljään laajaan tutkimuskysymykseen. Ensinnäkin, työ pyrkii esittämään käsitteellisen kehyksen, jolla voidaan ymmärtää eri pelien puitteissa tapahtuvaa roolipelaamista. Toiseksi, työ esittää käsitteellisen kehyksen arkeen sulautuvien pelien ymmärtämiseksi. Kolmanneksi, työssä tutkitaan prototyyppien avulla arkeen sulautuvien pelien ilmaisullista potentiaalia. Ja neljänneksi, työssä luodaan teoreettista pohjaa häviävien pelien tutkimiseksi. Työn keskeisin tulos on teoriamalli, jolla voidaan ymmärtää roolipelaamista ja arkeen sulautuvia pelejä viimeaikaisen pelitutkimuksen kontekstissa. Tällaisten pelien rajatapausten ymmärtämiseksi työ on rakennettu perustalle, jossa pelaamisen luonnetta sosiaalisena prosessina korostetaan. Tässä perustassa yhdistetään John R. Searlen heikkoa sosiaalista konstruktionismia mm. Jesper Juulin, Jane McGonigalin, Katie Salenin ja Eric Zimmermanin poikkitieteelliseen pelitutkimukseen.","2012","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2015-12-17 14:29:14","","253","","","","","On the Edge of the Magic Circle","","","","","Tampere University Press","Tampere","en","","Ph.D. Information Science","","","tampub.uta.fi","","Julkaisun pysyvä osoite on http://urn.fi/urn:isbn:978-951-44-8864-1","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dressed up as moon goddesses, mad scientists, and other fantastical characters, they act out elaborate, improvised narratives of transformation, destruction, and redemption. For several summers, this group, who I call the Journeyfolk, ran a camp for teenagers on the autism spectrum, engaging campers in therapeutic reconfigurations of self and social role. Through this folk healing practice, the meaning of autism was itself transformed; what had been a source of isolation became a source of commonality and community. This paper takes the camp as a case study for examining the co-productive relationship between culture and neurodiversity. Cognitive tendencies often found in autism are often thought to preclude socio-cultural participation. However, such tendencies can also facilitate the co-creation of innovative cultural spaces, through processes of affinity and affiliation. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at the camp, I identify three sites of congruity between the culture of the camp and the cognitive and phenomenological experiences associated with autism, at which this “work of culture” (Obeysekere in The Work of Culture: Symbolic Transformation in Psychoanalysis and Anthropology, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1990) took place: the structure of social interactions within roleplaying games, the narratives enacted within these games, and the interpersonal relationships within which the games were embedded.","2015","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2016-02-17 14:59:16","299-321","","2","39","","Cult Med Psychiatry","Making Meaningful Worlds","","","","","","","en","","","","2","link.springer.com","","Number: 2 QID: Q38427552","","","","_therapy; _attitude change; _autism; _fandom; _peer reviewed; _roleplay; =blogged; =0.66; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =citation-alert:WOS; =PM-lu; _LARP; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I discuss it as part of the recent participatory culture in which fans mediate existing fiction into other products such as games. Game studies have often bypassed types of gaming that are initiated by players themselves by taking professional and digital games as their starting points. By focussing on a local example of a fan game, I hope to provide new insights in game design and play. After disseminating between fan and game practices, and sketching some of the previous research thereof, I shall elaborate upon the design of the game in four ways by focussing on the designer, the context, the participants and its construction of meaningful play. I argue that the fan LARP displays a particular design perspective based on the co-creative ethos of role-playing and fandom itself. Whereas existing research isolates the actors that are relevant in game practices, designer, player and fan modes clearly interrelate here.","2011","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:24","","14–17","","","6","","","‘Can’t Stop The Signal?","","","","","DiGRA","Hilversum","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","sourceTanelorn; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Think Design Play","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this research is to present and define the concept of pedagogical live action role playing as a method of teaching history and examine its capability in teaching historical empathy. Pedagogical live action role playing is a teaching method under development which has elements from drama pedagogics and different learning theories. The theoretical part of this research consists of play theories and drama pedagogical theories which are relevant to live action role playing, and also the concepts of historical empathy and historical thinking. In drama pedagogics the main sources are the researches of Laakso (2004) and Heikkinen (2002, 2004). The historical part uses the researches of VanSledright (2002), Cooper (2000) and Ashby and Lee (1987) as its main sources.  The research was carried out at the Viikki Teacher Training School in the class 6b during autumn 2007. The research material consists of three-phased interviews. During all phases three pupils were interviewed, and during two of the phases, also the teacher of the class was interviewed. The methods used in the interviews were thematic interview and stimulated recall -interview. The data gathered from the interviews was analyzed using content analysis.  Pedagogical live action role playing has three phases when teaching history: pre-game (preparations), game (live action role play) and post-game (discussion after the game and in the classroom). The teacher's attention and carefulness is important during all phases. The mistakes made in the pre-game face e.g. in writing the characters seem to cause major problems in the pupils' game experiences.  Pedagogical live action role playing is capable of teaching historical empathy, but according to my research this has some conditions, from which the most important is the pupil's historical knowledge before the game. Teaching historical empathy was based on esthetic dualition: the pupil made decions about the actions of his character as him/herself.

The analysis of the player experience in Momentum is divided in three parts: how the frames of ordinary life and the game exist on top of each other, how the player slips from one frame to another, and how the participants of the game negotiate these frames with each other and with the non-participants they encounter.       The analysis is conducted using Erving Goffman’s (1974) frame analysis and Gary Alan Fine’s (1983) role-playing specific elaboration of it. It is based on participant observation, email interviews with the player before, during and after the games, as well as semi-structured interviews with half of the players after the game. In addition to the three frames that Fine has described in his study of tabletop role-playing games – the primary framework, the playing frame and the game frame – there are numerous other frames present in a pervasive larp. The participants shift between these numerous frames, but they also employ a dual vision, seeing the events both as ludic and as ordinary.       The work has been conducted as part of the EU-funded Integrated Project for Pervasive Gaming. The thesis tackles an isolated research question separated from the larger framework building on a theoretical framework developed in the context of IPerG by Markus Montola and Annika Waern. In addition to sociology the work builds on ludology (game studies).       In the thesis it is proposed that frame analysis is a good tool in uncovering the inner working of a pervasive larp. However, as a method it falls short when the analysis of the internal processes of a player is attempted. The thesis also offers results for the design theory of pervasive larps: It discusses what hinders and supports immersion and offers a general interaction model for socially expanded pervasive larps.","2008-05-12","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2016-02-09 20:35:43","","","","","","","The frames of pervasive live action role-playing games","","","","","University of Helsinki","Helsinki","fi","","MA Sociology","","","helda.helsinki.fi","","","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"88B4YQBM","thesis","2007","Copier, M.","Beyond the magic circle : A network perspective on role-play in online games","","","","","","Currently, game research is characterized by the (re)construction of contested boundaries such as the “magic circle” of the game experience. These boundaries create dichotomies, for instance, between the real and the imaginary that hide the complexity of actual play, design and research. In this thesis I propose to go “beyond the magic circle” in order to understand games and play from a network perspective. My case study is role-play in the online game World of Warcraft (Blizzard Entertainment 2004), whereby players act out the roles of their Fantasy characters. I understand Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) as networks of social interaction in which players (human actors) interact both with each other and with the system (nonhuman actors). Through interaction, role-players are creating meaning and social bonds that stretch out far beyond dichotomies such as in-character and out-of-character, in-game and out of game, real and imaginary, leisure and work or education, virtual and material, online and offline. The emergence of Fantasy role-playing games, of which the pen and paper game Dungeons and Dragons (D&D, 1974) is the first and World of Warcraft (WoW, Blizzard Entertainment, 2004) is one of the latest incarnations, ties in with the development of what sociologist Manuel Castells termed the network society. Through rich empirical case studies in his trilogy The Information Age: economy, society and culture (1996, 1997 and 1998), he mapped how since the late 1960s we have been witnessing a shift from hierarchies to networks in all sectors of society. Castells’ work is part of a growing body of network theory in which our society, including science itself, is understood as a complex system shaped by processes within and between actor networks that are often powered by information and communication technologies. In order to study MMORPGs as networks, I made use of Actor Network Theory as it is formulated within science and technology studies (Callon 1986, Law 1987, Latour 1987, 2005), Thomas Gieryn's concept of boundary work (Gieryn 1983, 1999), Erving Goffman’s work on social interaction (Goffman 1956, 1974), and the concept of “situatedness,” a crucial addition that Donna Haraway made to network theory, which aims to make visible how scholars are positioned in constantly morphing network structures (Haraway 1991). This thesis contributes to 1) an understanding of online role-playing games as networks that interact with daily life, Fantasy game culture, and the broader technological and socio-cultural developments over the last thirty years; 2) a description and analysis of role-play as a specific MMORPG play style that is characterized by its negotiation principles, and thus to understand the roles, conventions, identities, and interpersonal relationships that self-proclaimed role-players negotiate in and through the systems of a commercially distributed game; and, finally, 3) an understanding of how collaborative play, design, and game research are closely intertwined. Going “beyond the magic circle” has profound implications for both epistemology and education in game research and design. A network epistemology asks for interdisciplinary academic work that combines not only scholarship from the humanities and social sciences, but also from computer sciences. Furthermore, it calls for a societal contextualization of scholarship and a connecting of fundamental and applied theorization both “inside” and “outside” academia, done by players, designers, and academics, roles that more often can be found in one person. A networked education teaches a specialization in the context of other research and design disciplines, as the ability and passion to create unexpected blends is crucial for future innovative developments in play, design, and research.","2007-06-12","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-07 14:20:59","","","228","","","","","Beyond the magic circle","","","","","Utrecht University","Utrecht","en","","Ph.D.","","","DART-Europe","","","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _social media; =cleaned; _LARP; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY","magic circle; Actor-network theory; Computergames; Network society; Network theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus of this particular study is on a predominately all male campus group of ""Live Action Role Players"" called ""Dagorhir.""  I explore how sub-cultural processes in the construction of group identity are gendered through their relation to the manhood acts perspective (Schrock & Schwalbe, 2009). I focus on how the meanings of actions by (mostly male) participants referred to as ""epic glory"" relate to the elicitation of deference, resistance of exploitation, and assertion of control key in signifying manhood.

The conception of framing used here draws upon and extends Goffman’s definition of a frame as part of the organization of activity that specifies meaning and expectations of involvement. In looking at the setting of such framing processes ethnographically, this article presents UK LARP as a distinctive engagement with rural materiality and a creative alternative to traditional country pursuits. From the point of view of a game organizer, the paper identifies the creation of specific contextual frames by the visiting hobbyists associated with three interpretations: 1) a narrative conception of the space as a backdrop for fantastical events, 2) a ludic conception of the space as an area of game-playing, 3) an event conception of the space and its inhabitants as something to be managed. Three examples of disruptions to the work employed to maintain these frames demonstrate the fragility of the magic involved in this fantastical hobby. © The British Association of Hand Therapists Ltd 2015.","2016","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","326-349","","3","17","","","Materiality, magic and belief","","","","","","","en","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Number: 3","","","","_therapy; _peer reviewed; =0.66; =cleaned; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","Context; frame analysis; framing; rural","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It proposes various perspectives on game time and integrates them to allow coherent representation of the same events in the different perspectives. The model has been tested across tabletop and digital formats, and its applicability across game formats is demonstrated. Emphasis is placed on multiplayer and massively multiplayer role-playing games because these feature complex game time behavior not previously evaluated.

Well-defined characters that are consistently communicated to players are an important ingredient in a potentially successful game. In this paper I will explore the important aspects in a character, those that support and make character immersion possible. My starting point is that in a role-playing game posing as somebody else is elementary to the game. This is close to arguments that character immersion is a key element of a role-playing. The pleasurable role-playing experience thus requires a player to be able to present a character and (to some extent) experience what the character is experiencing.","2004","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:52:11","","139-148","","","","","","","","","","","Ropecon ry","Helsinki","en","","","","","","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _character; _LARP","","Montola, Markus; Stenros, Jaakko","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It sets the theoretical frame for the game “Staying Alive,” in which the researchers and also the audience engage in a shared “mimetic evocation of ‘real-life experience.’” Many aspects of “everydayness” can be called “collateral realities,” realities that are done implicitly, unintentionally, such as nations, cultures, time, or distinctions of subject and object, or of presenter and audience; realities that could be different. Taking performativity seriously, larp can be a tool to step outside of a Euro-American commonsense ontology and its singular reality “out there” by playing with collateral realities and making their production explicit. During a larp, players (“larpers”) consciously undo objects and meanings, space, and even their very bodies to creatively weave new material-semiotic fabrics. They become cultural mediators between a world-that-supposedly-just-is and its partially connected others, in which Japaneseness or Chineseness may fade and Elvishness is translated into a reality. With a global player base, larping is not only a practice of intersubjective or cultural negotiations but also of intra-subjective mediation of cultural realities.","2016","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2017-05-01 20:47:35","35-51","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","Singapore","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-981-10-0575-6_4","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach - Project System is a three-day experience for adult participants concerning totalitarian regime, freedom and inequality. The Project System does not give fast and easy answers but leads participants to find them on their own. For 30 hours, participants find themselves within a larp, which is a very intense type of role-playing game based on human interactions. The author has chosen a larp as a medium as one of the most immersive and influential method of game-based learning which can facilitate topics that are normally hard to explain through conventional methods of learning. Participants learn firsthand through their roles, emotions, story and experience. Findings - Project System was a really strong and important experience for many players that may have partially changed their lives. After more than 500 players walked through it, the author can say that this method is beneficial. Originality/value - Larp as an educational tool is used all over the world; however, there are still only few professional organizations. Most of them are focused on using larp (or similar role-playing methods) as a tool at elementary or secondary schools. Using larp in andragogy is currently pioneering.","2017","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-11-02 18:38:12","","218-227","","2-3","14","","World J. Sci. Technol. Sustain.

For Jung, active imagination is a process by which theperson engages in an awakening, creative exploration of his ownpsyche through free play of fantasy, narrative, and dialogue withdifferent “characters” representing archetypes of the collectiveunconscious. Those fantasies are usually registered as words,images, or other forms of artistic expression. Such confrontationwith one’s unconscious may lead a person to become a morebalanced and unified Self; a process known as individuation.Though observing the differences between the lonely therapeuticactivity of active imagination and the social entertaining activityof role-playing, this article postulates that Jung’s process revealsimportant insights within the nature of creativity. A role-playinggame is an interactive activity in which the players representcharacters in a narrative, having the freedom to affect fictionaccording to their creativity and choices. This article exploresthe extent to which active imagination correlates with acting inrole-playing by examining the potential for shadow work andindividuation within the structure of a game. Individuation ispossible after the engagement in a creative play, provided that theparticipants judge it a valuable process, and gain some personalinsights, by means of further reflection.","2017","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-12-21 15:43:25","","158-173","","9","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.academia.edu","","Number: 9","","","","_creativity; _therapy; _identity; _psychoanalysis; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, furries rarely reveal their furry identity to mental health professionals, for fear of judgment or disapproval. Improving health practitioners' familiarity with the furry identity may improve the quality of care for furries seeking treatment for unrelated conditions. Six focus groups were conducted over three days at a furry convention in the Midwest United States to study the furry identity (59 self-identified furries ages 18 to 41). The authors define and describe the demographics of important distinctions within the furry community and discuss the furry identity and liken it to sexual orientation, noting that the stigma furries face—worsened by media that exaggerate fringe and rare behaviors—has made it challenging for furries to live authentically for fear of ostracism, violence, and discrimination. These factors have resulted in furries' reluctance to disclose their identities. Highlighting communication challenges, the authors discuss strategies for health professionals to engage with furries in a clinical setting and to uphold unconditional positive regard.","2015","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:06","","e42-e50","","2","40","","Health Soc Work","Clinical Interaction with Anthropomorphic Phenomenon","","","","","","","","","","","","academic.oup.com","","Number: 2","","","","_peer reviewed; =0.66; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discussing fictional worlds theory, Aristotle, Frye, and Ricoeur along side concepts from game studies, such as the magic circle and the frames of exogeny, endogeny, and diegesis, I propose an alternative approach to understanding narrative within larps that looks at the larp worlds and plot as being driven by a process of affirming the identities constructed to participate within the fictional worlds through the mimetic process.","2016","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-09-21 16:11:06","","","86","","","","","","","","","","McMaster University","Hamilton, ON","en","","MA English and Cultural Studies","","","macsphere.mcmaster.ca","","","","","","=cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research on the use of roleplays finds that the more realistic the roleplay, the more effective it is as a teaching tool, at least for easily definable behaviors. Activities such as leadership, decision making, and working with a group are all behaviors that are difficult to precisely define but which are also critically important to the ability of a group to accomplish a task. Research on groups finds that groups are more effective when group members are better educated about each of these topics. Viewed from a Dramaturgical perspective, leadership, decision making, and working with a group can be seen as group members filling certain roles and engaging in role appropriate activities in order to accomplish the tasks of the group and manage the impressions group members have of one another. This study employed a qualitative, grounded theory methodology to explore how participants in Live Action Role Playing (LARP) games, a form of immersive, complex, plot-driven roleplay perceive leadership, decision making, and working with a group. A total of 14 participants provided rich, detailed responses to an open-ended questionnaire that explored their perceptions of each of the three topics being investigated, and also explored how they perceived LARP as influencing those perceptions. Based on the results of the study, a theory was developed connecting LARP participation to an enhanced ability to understand leadership, decision making, and working with a group.","2016","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2017-11-29 14:56:59","","205","","","","","","","","","","Capella University","Minneapolis, MN","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Social and Behavioral Sciences","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_leadership; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY","Play; Leadership; Psychology; Decision making; Roleplaying","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, like all other forms of art, games can also be created to convey painful experiences. This article studies two non-digital freeform role-playing games, The Journey and Gang Rape, that aim to create extreme experiences of tragedy, horror, disgust, powerlessness and self-loathing. Even though the games successfully produce unpleasant experiences, they gratify their target group of experienced role-players. Almost all of the sixteen interviewed players appreciated their experiences, despite crying, experiencing physiological stress reactions and feeling generally ‘bad’ during play. It was also found out that players feel intimately connected after play, and felt the need for thorough debriefing afterwards.

This book examines fantasy from a performance theory perspective. Drawing on multidisciplinary literature, it presents ethnographic and art-based research on live action role-playing games to explore fantasy as a bodily and negotiated phenomenon that involves various kinds of engagement with one’s surroundings. Overall, this book is a study of various forms and roles that fantasy can take on as part of contemporary Western culture. The study suggests that fantasy emerges as a different type of interpretation of normalised performance and reality, and can thus provide individuals with the tools to wield agency in everyday life. The book will appeal to scholars of sociology, cultural and media studies, literature and performance studies.","2019","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","206","","","","","","Routledge Advances in Sociology","248","","","Routledge","New York, NY","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","BF175.5.F36 S477 2019","","","","","_theater; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The author also mentions (but not go deep into) the fact that the setting and plot of a particular larp also can be classified in the same manner.

This is not known. In this study with a unique design and intervention, young adults (N = 128; a heterogeneous sample) learned how to control an electro-mechanical device in a 40-minute-long learning session integrated into a 2-hour-long educational live action role-playing game (edu-LARP). Edu-LARPs are supposedly engaging games where players take part in team role-playing by physically enacting characters in a fictional universe. In our edu-LARP, players had to understand how the to-be-learned device worked in order to win the game. Departing from typical game-based learning research, learning- and playing-related variables were assessed for each learner separately (i.e., a within-subject design). Affective-motivational factors related to playing (rather than learning) predicted learning outcomes in a positive, but considerably weaker, way compared to learning-related, affective-motivational factors. Developed interest in LARP-like games was primarily related to enjoying the game rather than better learning outcomes; whereas, developed interest in the instructional domain was primarily related to enjoyment of learning and better learning outcomes. Overall, autonomous motivation to play was connected to higher learning outcomes, but this connection was weak.","2019","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-20 01:59:57","2019-08-19 14:30:52","64-90","","3","7","","","It’s Better to Enjoy Learning than Playing","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2019 Frontline Learning Research","","","","journals.sfu.ca","","Number: 3 QID: Q114772182","","","","_playfulness; _motivation; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Positive interpretation of the specified subject can serve as an additional material for further profound studying of such diverse phenomenon as reconstruction. The article purpose is to actualize the importance of the historical reconstruction, acting as an effective way of receiving new knowledge of the past of society in the context of education and upbringing of the younger generation. The source base of our research was made by a wide range of various sources: 1) the documents of the movement, including charters of clubs of historical reconstruction, the rules, the program, the regulations for running events etc.; 2) the Internet resources, presented by the websites and associations of clubs of historical reconstruction, which give the chance to expand the source base, and also to fill the niche, which was formed due to the lack of appropriate number of publications about this movement in Russia. The methodology and technique of the research is based on the principles of scientificity, the principles of dialectical connection of the cultural phenomena and processes; methods of theoretical and applied cultural science, and also the cultural and anthropological method, allowing to consider culture as the instrument of broadcast of new knowledge and practical skills in cultural and leisure domain of society. Despite the considerable amount of literature on various aspects of historical reconstruction, there is insufficiency of scientific developments on the subject of our research. At the same time, different types of reconstruction on the problems of its educational potential, gaming and cultural phenomenon have been examined by S.V. Bogdanov, N.S. Bozhk, E.M. Veselova, I.V. Glukharev, A.N. Milyukov, etc. While conducting the research, the authors have come to the conclusions that the amateur movement, including elements of the scientific direction, promotes development of interest in historical roots of people, knowledge of features of cross-cultural communication. The Internet resources, which provide the programs of numerous clubs of historical reconstruction, conducting scientific search, carrying out cultural and educational and general education work, serve as the confirmation to it. The monitoring of the concrete movement practices has shown that accumulation of knowledge of the past of society passes along most effectively in the form of thematic feasts, role-playing games of live action, show, which communicative space creates a unique opportunity to acquire new knowledge by preparation for game action. Thus, the prospects for further development of the phenomenon of historical reconstruction in getting to know the past of society consists in the analysis of various activities of participants of the movement on preservation of material and non-material cultural heritage, on reconstruction of ancient technologies under modern conditions, and also in continuous link of times, generations, traditions, providing inviolability of moral values and patriotic spirit among young people.","2019","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 16:16:49","","110-116","","","59","","Vestn.

Current research methods for probing the future of markets and society rely mainly on expert judgment (i.e. Delphi), imagery or simulation of possible futures (i.e. scenario and simulation) and perspective taking (i.e. role-playing). The predominant focus on cognitive abstraction limits the insights researchers can extract from more embodied, sensorial and experiential approaches. LARPnography is a qualitative method seeking to immerse participants within a plausible future to better understand the social and market dynamics that may unfold therein. Through careful planning, design, casting and fieldwork, researchers create the preconditions to let participants experience what the future may be and gather critical insights from naturalistic observations and post-event interviews. Owing to its interactive nature and processual focus, LARPnography is best suited to investigate the adoption and diffusion of innovation, market emergence phenomena and radical societal changes, including the rise of alternative societies. Different from previous foresight methods, LARPnography creates immersive and perceptually stimulating replicas of plausible futures that research participants can inhabit. The creation of a fictional yet socio-material world ensures that socially constructed meaning is enriched by phenomenological and visceral insights.","2019","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2019-09-12 17:49:36","1637-1664","","8","53","","","LARPnography","","","","","","","en","© Emerald Publishing Limited 2018","","","","ProQuest","","Number: 8","","","","_peer reviewed; _roleplay; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","Delphi method; Embodied embedded cognition; Ethnography; Futures and foresight; Scenario method","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation argues that virtual worlds need not exist as online, digital environments alone and probes three genres of non-digital gaming for evidence of the virtual: tabletop role-playing games, murder-mystery events, and localized alternate reality games. More broadly, then, this dissertation is about deliberate make-belief: practiced by adults, taken seriously by participants, engaged with for long hours at a time, performed in public, and integrated into everyday social relationships. Drawing on scholars who study games as social activities (McGonigal 2006, Montola 2012) and social institutions (Goffman 1974, Searle 1995), I present three ethnographic case studies that illustrate how complex forms of social gaming can conjure and sustain environments best understood as analog virtual worlds. Through the widespread use of mobile technologies and the concerted efforts of innovators, game spaces are increasingly permeating our everyday lives on- and offline. This dissolving boundary demands anthropologists to revisit questions of how, where, and with whom we play games. Dovetailing Martin Heidegger’s notions of worlding and poiesis to the semiotics of C.S. Peirce, this dissertation investigates how new forms of social gaming demonstrate the same qualities of shared intentionality, intersubjectivity, and performance essential to the production of new social meaning and cultural forms. Following, I situate the bold ethnographic case studies of make-belief in dialogue with scholars who figure exclusively online virtual worlds (Castronova 2005, Taylor 2006, Boellstorff 2008) and argue that analyzing both on- and offline virtual worlds together can help scholars better understand the fundamental nature of social interaction and shared intentionality, those everyday mechanisms that both sustain personal relationships on the one hand and maintain our broadest and most serious social institutions on the other.","2015","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2019-09-24 13:48:58","","283","","","","","The social poetics of analog virtual worlds","","","","","The University of Texas at Austin","Austin, TX","en","","Ph.D. Thesis Anthropology","","","repositories.lib.utexas.edu","","","","","","_worldbuilding; _TTRPG; _murder party; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The history of larp, live-action role-play, in Japan may be rather short but documents exponential growth in the entertainment sector as well as in educational gaming. Following trends of related forms of analog role-playing games, the horror genre functions as a motor of increasing popularity., Aim. This article explores the development of non-digital role-playing games in the Japanese context in light of the online video platform niconico popularizing horror role-playing and practical considerations of adopting the genre to live-action play., Method. Cyberethnographic fieldwork including participant observation at larps between 2015 and 2018 forms the data basis for this article, followed by qualitative interviews with larp organizers, larp writers, and designers of analog games as well as observations online in respective webforums., Results. Replays, novelized transcripts of play sessions, have been an entry point into analog role-playing in Japan since the 1980s. With the advent of video sharing sites, replays moved from the book to audio-visual records and a focus on horror games. Creating a fertile ground for this genre, the first indigenous Japanese larp rulebook built on this interest and the ease of access, namely that players do not need elaborate costumes or equipment to participate in modern horror., Discussion. The dominant form of larps in Japan are one-room games, that work well with horror mysteries and function as a low threshold of accessibility. Furthermore, the emotional impact of horror larps, the affective interaction between players and their characters, allows for memorable experiences and so continues to draw in new players and organizers.","2019-10-01","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2019-10-30 19:42:52","621-644","","5","50","","Simulation & Gaming","A Short History of Table-Talk and Live-Action Role-Playing in Japan","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Number: 5","","","","_japan; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted a laboratory experiment, in which participants (253 high school students, M = 112, F = 141, mean age 16.5) studied EU laws, institutions, and politics in the three above-mentioned environments. We evaluated and compared mental models participants constructed through content analysis of the concept maps they drew immediately after the experiment and others made one month later. Within the analysis, we studied content, architecture, and changes in mental models over time. The resulting data offer unique insight into the process of mental models creation and sustainability thereof within game-based learning; particularly, when using a digital game. Digital game-based learners’ concept maps differed in comparison with those of the educational role-playing and traditional lecture groups; the students tended to keep less altered mental models in their long-term memory: even after the one month period. The results suggest that a digital game-based learning environment could be more successful in mental model retention and for efficacy of future recall; particularly, when dealing with complex phenomena like EU law.","2020-05-05","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2020-07-20 00:43:15","29-52","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2020 Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology","","","","journals.muni.cz","","Number: 1","","","","_peer reviewed; _roleplay; =cleaned; _law studies; _LARP; _LEARNING","Concept Maps; Digital Game-based Learning; Mental Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The following research methods were used in this study: “Questionnaire of the hierarchical structure of actual personal fears” (ISAS) methodology to identify phobias; Personality Belief Questionnaire – PBQ to specify dysfunctional beliefs impeding adaptation (emotional well-being, constructive relationships with other people, etc.). The research results suggest that a systematic integrated approach is a necessary condition for the success of the psychological technology aimed at overcoming negative experiences and maladaptation of ""role"" movement subculture representatives. A combination of diagnostic and correctional models to overcome social fears, deprivation and maladaptation makes up the essence of the technology. The research provides findings that can be used by managers of various levels in the education system, social workers, teachers and practical psychologists in the education system; they can also be of use while organizing special programs for educators, social and psychological services. It has been worked out to help students - “roleviks” to overcome their social fears. It represents a system of single interrelated activities determined to form and develop personal adaptive resources. It has been established that positive changes in adaptation strategies, a decrease in the level of social fears and anxiety are the main criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the presented psychological-pedagogical technology. It is shown that the applied technology promotes the decrease of experienced fears intensity, forms stress resistance, and contributes to the selection of effective social interaction strategies.","2020","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:51:34","2020-12-17 19:39:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","This work is licensed under a Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)","","","","rua.ua.es","","Accepted: 2020-09-09T06:55:53Z Publisher: Universidad de Alicante.

It appears that up to around 2010 there was a general acceptance of risk, with a significant share of responsibility for risk identification and harm prevention put on the player. This correlates with mechanics such as safety words, which expected players in distress to actively signal their discomfort. Safety measures expected from the organisers consisted mainly in providing safe off-game spaces, emotional support, and intervention whenever something harmful happened. Around 2014 the safety debate put a larger share of responsibility on players initiating potentially troubling interactions. This correlates with the ‘OK check’ mechanics which requires communication between the initiator and the target of such interactions. Around 2016 the safety debate moved to the position in which it requires organisers and participants to do their best to prevent harm from ever happening. This finds its expression in the rapidly expanding toolkit of mechanics of consent and calibration, which clearly put responsibility for overstepping someone’s boundaries on the one who oversteps. To simplify, the first approach obliged players and organisers to taking care of those who signalled they needed it. The second approach required caution and care in testing someone’s boundaries. The last one states that boundaries are to be carefully identified and respected – not tested.","2020","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-11-16 15:17:20","2021-01-26 19:16:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.academia.edu","","","","","","_safe space; _nordic larp; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While research has investigated the role of training and simulations, little is known about how individuals develop improvisation skills when formal training is not an option and how individual-level factors shape development trajectories. We explore these issues in a longitudinal qualitative analysis of live action role-playing. Our findings reveal a three-stage process of improvisation development shaped by the presence of task and social structures, which act as both constraints and resources. Moreover, our findings illuminate how collaborative and competitive orientations shape whether improvisers perceive these structures as a resource that they need to nurture and renew (i.e., collaborative) or to seize and exploit (i.e., competitive). We also show that individual orientations are not always enduring but can change over time, engendering four types of improvisation development trajectories. Our work provides a longitudinal account of how individual orientations shape the process of improvisation development. In so doing, we also explain why individuals who are skilled improvisers do not necessarily improvise effectively as a collective, and we reconcile different conceptualizations of improvisation.","2020-11-23","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-15 04:06:15","2021-03-18 02:33:17","0001839220975697","","","","","Administrative Science Quarterly","Developing Improvisation Skills","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","_major publication; _improvisation; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; =PM-obsidianized; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Demonstrating that non-digital role-plays, such as TRPG and LARP, share many features with RH, the book contends that all three may be considered as heritage practices. Studying these role-plays as three distinct genres of playful, participatory and performative forms of engagement with cultural heritage, Mochocki demonstrates how an exploration of the affordances of each genre can be valuable. Showing that a player’s engagement with history or heritage material is always multi-layered, the book clarifies that the layers may be conceptualised simultaneously as types of heritage authenticity and as types of in-game immersion. It is also made clear that RH, TRPG and LARP share commonalities with a multitude of other media, including video games, historical fiction and film. Existing within, and contributing to, the fiction and non-fiction mediasphere, these role-enactments are shaped by the same large-scale narratives and discourses that persons, families, communities, and nations use to build memory and identity. Role-play as a Heritage Practice will be of great interest to academics and students engaged in the study of heritage, memory, nostalgia, role-playing, historical games, performance, fans and transmedia narratology.","2021","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-05 15:01:12","","","305","","","","","Role-play as a Heritage Practice","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Lm4ZEAAAQBAJ","","","","_museum; _rttp; _history; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of these performance concepts are how LARP can be considered “improv in disguise,” how the use of rules systems both helps and hinders ideas of agency and immersion, and how issues of consent are essential to the success of creating a shared reality among diverse personalities. The article begins with an auto-ethnographic description of the LARP event Broken Covenant, which leads to explaining how LARGE began and how it differs from more well-known boffer LARPS. The article then drills down on the varied histories of the interview subjects and explores the concept of improvisation in LARP as ‘yes, but…,’ in comparison to the well-known improv mantra of ‘yes, and. …’ Agency and immersion are explored, leading to a discussion of emotional investment and, most important, consent.

The medium is immensely versatile and different larp traditions approach the activity and its design in a variety of ways.    The participatory and ephemeral nature of larp makes it a difficult medium to explore without playing. It is, however, relevant to communicate aspects of the activity to external audiences for purposes of posterity and recognition. Larp documentation cannot encapsulate the fleeting artwork, as it lacks a permanent form. As the player is the central audience of larp, we seek to understand the player experience in order to comprehend the relevance of larp. The importance of documentation forces the larp community to explore new ways of capturing the dissipating artworks.    The study explores what can be captured of the ephemeral larp experience, and how it translates to outside audiences. The written part of the study examines characteristics of larp and central challenges for its documentation, as well as the creation of a fictional documentary film. The artistic part of the study is the outcome of an exploration of larp as a platform for creation, resulting in a fictional documentary called “Vielä hetki.”    The study shows that while larp is impossible to document thoroughly, parts of the ephemeral larp experience can be captured. Larp documentation should be approached as a collection of different documents, as no single document or medium can cover the whole larp. The medium can be used as a source for sampling, as larp provides a platform for artistic exploration but only allows parts of its expression to be captured. It is possible to create independent works of art inside larp that external audiences can relate to and to utilize such artworks in translating the exclusive larp experience to non-participants. When larp documentation is implemented into the fiction of the larp, it becomes a diegetic part of the larp and creates more intimate documents of the elusive and coveted player experience.","2019","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-15 04:18:25","2021-05-04 13:34:06","","59","","","","","","","","","","Aalto University","","en","","Master Thesis.

While ‘playing with’ usually refers to the specific objects used as toys and ‘playing at’ to the roles assumed in such play, examining play situations from the perspective of the make-believe theory of representation (prop theory) suggests a specific relationship between these two aspects of playing. By examining which props are being used in any given play situation, and comparing their metaphorical position in the foreground or background of the imaginary game being played, parallels and distinctions between different kinds of play can be explored and contrasted.

This presentation from members of the Transformative Play Initiative at he Uppsala University Campus Gotland's discusses the potential of live action role-playing games (larps) as vehicles for embodied experiential learning and therapeutic interventions.  Presenters:  Elektra Diaklolambrianou, Institution for Counseling and Psychological Studies Josephine Baird, Uppsala University Josefin Westborg, Uppsala University Sarah Lynne Bowman, Uppsala University Larp is a type of improvisational performance that involves spontaneous co-creation between players enacting characters in a fictional setting for a bounded period of time. This format encourages agency and collaboration as a means to playfully co-construct identity and reality within a group setting, which can lead to an increased sense of internal locus of control, as well as meta-reflection. This presentation contextualizes larp with relationship to other therapeutic modalities that use storytelling and/or role enactment , e.g. psychodrama, sociodrama, Gestalt, narrative therapy, Integral Family Systems, inner child work, drama therapy, person-centred therapy etc. The presenters discuss some of the cognitive elements that make larp particularly useful as a tool, including the development of perspective taking, empathy, and metacognitive awareness through the dual consciousness of identification with character and aesthetic distancing. The presentation explore larp’s potential as a vehicle for learning -- including its limitations -- with an emphasis on theories of assimilation, accommodation, and cognitive dissonance, e.g. Knud Illeris’ work building upon concepts from Jean Piaget.  The presentation discusses a specific example of the ways players can use larp as a playground to experiment with identity and personally transform. This example centers upon player who use role-playing as a space for queer performance where they can feel secure enough in their containment to physically present as different gender identities than were assigned to them at birth. This process can not only feel radically liberating for queer participants, but can be paired with adjunctive therapeutic modalities to aid in their process of transitioning their gender socially outside of playful spaces. Thus, this presentation considers the potential of larp as a transformational container or holding environment for experimentation that can support other therapeutic processes occurring parallel to play.

Larps offer a place where emotions and affectivities are transmitted through the embodiment of characters. Larps offer forms of likenessing, which create new affective states for the players. We conclude that larps can be powerful tools for portraying political alternatives of actual events, and they can serve a role in raising awareness. Larps offer a productive context for studying subjectivities where the focus is on affective relationalities because larps place the participants in social positions where they take up roles that might be inaccessible to them in everyday life.

In the existing literature such terms as “immersion” and “diegetic space” fly about, almost taking a life of their own, but no one seems to direct too much interest towards how they are achieved by the human mind. In some respects, this lack of immediate interest is no wonder, since the ability to picture and act out imagined scenarios is such an integrated part of everyday life; even though it might be one of the truly wonderful and unique aspects of being human. The paper shows what human abilities are involved in the creation of roleplaying experience, how immersion is achieved in terms of representation, and what tried and tested terms can be borrowed from cognitive science to explain these more “airy” aspects of the phenomenon.","2006","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-07 18:32:19","2016-02-09 20:22:16","67-84","","","","","","","","","","","Föreningen Knutepunkt","Stockholm","en","","","","","","","","","","","_immersion; _major publication; _empathy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =SD; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; neuroscience","","Fritzon, Thorbiörn; Wrigstad, Tobias","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their claims place them among heritage and cultural interpreters in how they connect the past with the audience before them. However, the practice of Civil War reenacting has come under scrutiny in recent years for propagating a narrow view of history informed predominantly by nostalgic ideas of a Confederate lost-cause narrative. Through personal experience as a reenactor and living history interpreter, together with in-depth research of these practices, I propose that Civil War reenacting may at times include interpretive practices, however, its primary function as a hobbyist’s pastime places it in the realm of Live Action Roleplaying (LARPing) rather than heritage interpretation. From this, Civil War reenactments are largely based on the relationship between historically inspired personas and the actors’ own personalities rather than creating an interpretive experience for the public audience. It is the confusion between these two tendencies that has resulted in the fields of American Civil War reenactments becoming breeding grounds where ideologically narrow views of history and national identity may be perpetuated.","2021","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-03-03 02:55:03","2021-10-18 20:15:37","","135","","","","","Interpreting the Game of History","","","","","","Ann Arbor, United States","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798538150472","","","","=cleaned; _LARP","Roleplaying; Civil War reenactors; Heritage reenactment; Historical interpretation; Live Action Roleplaying; Living history; Museum theatre; Reenactment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It frames role-playing to the simulating research methods, opens its epistemological pro- perites and methodological conceptions in social psyschology. Main argument constructs the defense of epistemological properties of active role-playing as an experimental method in the social sciences in general. The inspiring source is one the side Latour's sociology of associations, which problematizes the very subject of social sciences, the sociality itself and on the other side the naturalizing approaches connecting social sciences and cognitive science. In this context main argument for meaningfulness of simulated social reality lies in the usage of the same cognitive mechanisms in the real and simulated so- cial interaction. In the article perspective both sources are united by their accent on perceiving social reality as fundamentaly interpsychological phenomenon between the traditional conpcetions micro and macro level.

We describe some of the barriers to transformation that can arise from alibi, cognitive dissonance, role-distancing, and the pressures of conformity. We will then examine role-playing from two quite different lenses: a) Conceptualizations of ritual, aspecting, and manifestation in occult and metaphysical traditions; and b Research in the social sciences about the power of thought and narrative upon self-concept, behavior, performance, and well-being. This preliminary exploration of concepts that might help explain the potential of role-playing as a form of postmodern “magic” is by no means exhaustive or detailed. Rather, we present vignettes of thought from various areas of spiritual practice and social science. We explore how role-playing, perspective taking, narrative, ritual, and the conscious use of specific imaginative practices can directly impact people’s performance at tasks, their self-concepts, and their perceived agency. Then, we examine different models of bleed theory, investigating ways that we can raise awareness around bleed effects and consciously steer toward or away from them as needed. If we intentionally emphasize responsibility, safety, and growth in our communities, we can imagine the role-playing space as a transformational container within which we can explore our edges and mold our self-concepts through play. We can use alibi as a tool to permit greater experimentation, while decreasing its strength when we wish to transfer skills, insights, and personality traits outside of the magic circle. Finally, through conscious and deliberate integration practices, we can distill these insights and more permanently infuse our lives with this magic, manifesting new conceptions of self, of community, of relationships, and of our life potential.","2021","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-02-09 15:51:34","2022-01-02 19:27:37","","","","","","","Magic is Real","","","","","Knutepunkt","Oslo","en","","","","","www.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_bleed; _ritual; _identity; _fandom; _social contract; _embodiment; _well-being; _TTRPG; _transformative; =cleaned; _distantiation; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","","Djukastein, Kari; Irgens, Marcus; Lipsyc, Nadja; Sunde, Lars Kristian Løveng","","","Hugaas, Kjell Hedgard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The challenge here is how to frame “audience ethnography” in contexts where the relationship between audience and performer is blurred. This can involve a range of dynamics, whether the performer and audience are one and the same, such as in online or live action roleplaying, or in cases where audience agency has an active role in composing the work. Many of these forms do not allow for passive participation, requiring researchers to actively engage in the coperformance. Through the lenses of performance and feminist ethnography, participant engagement frames the embodied researcher as performer and the act of participant observation as a performance to address three paradoxes inherent in studying immersive fictional worlds: (1) the need to adopt a fictional persona compatible with the world being studied; (2) the need to fully engage with the play activities proscribed by the fictional context; (3) the need to reconcile the inherent contradiction within factual ethnographic accounts of a fictional worlds.","2022","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","Playing ethnography","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","DOI:https://doi.org/10.4324/9781032214146","","","","_theater; _anthropology; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY","","Dani Snyder-Young, Matt Omasta","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two hundred two students were randomly assigned to two conditions, a game-based variant simulating an emergency situation (experimental group), and an instruction-based approach (control group). After the intervention participants completed a questionnaire assessing self-prediction, self-efficacy, attitude, subjective norm, empathy and competence. The largest arguably significant difference between the two groups showed in self-prediction and capacity beliefs. Results further revealed a positive relationship between self-prediction and the variables attitude and self-efficacy. The type of scenario did not translate into the other concepts we assessed, though, and results were inconclusive regarding the effectiveness of the type of learning scenario and CPR knowledge.

I examine threads from a Facebook group discussing the topic, and code the reactions of men participating. I discuss how some gamer masculinities that are displayed reinforces a belief of epistemic privilege among White men that allows for hegemonic responses to discussions that involve structural racism. I propose larp gamer masculinity as a hybrid masculinity, complicit in its support of hegemonic models but appropriating elements of subordinated populations to allow individuals to feel like an “outsider.” In these gaming discourse spaces, men employ an anti-intellectualized form of digital hooliganism as a rationale for their claims. These men dismiss claims of discrimination as they see those as characteristics outside the scope of the game. The resistance exhibited by these men reacting to changes should be viewed differently than extremist discourses.","2022-03-31","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2024-03-18 18:28:14","2022-04-04 19:12:51","5-43","","1","31","","The Journal of Men’s Studies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","_dnd; _gender; _LARP; _minority; _peer reviewed; _SOCIOLOGY; _TTRPG; =cleaned","discourse; hybrid masculinity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, larping often relies on problematic engagements with race and racial stereotypes. Like many gaming hobbies, larp uses the idea of a “playable race”. Unlike other gaming arenas, however, larping necessitates that players physically embody a character in order to participate in the collaborative narrative: larpers embody fictional races and engage in a complex form of “race play”. Within this context, non-Indigenous players frequently appropriate Indigenous cultural practices and mobilize racist stereotypes. This paper explores this phenomenon and its ramifications. Based on seven years of ethnographic fieldwork and community participation in New England larping communities, I examine how concepts of Indigenous identity manifest in New England larp. I explore both Indigenous and non-Indigenous perspectives in order to demonstrate (a) how fantastical play facilitates cultural appropriation and damaging “race play” and (b) how these spaces affect Indigenous players. I close with Indigenous perspectives on new possibilities for Indigenous larp projects and cultural reclamation.","2020","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-03-14 13:49:08","2022-04-06 20:42:31","143-161","","4","9","","","Playing at the Margins","","","","","","","en","© 2020.

D’autre part, il fait appel au modèle MÉDIAL (Caïra, 2018) qui distingue plusieurs dimensions de l’engagement ludique.

Participants can appreciate the performative excellence of individual performances and other skilful exhibitions, there is a visual surface that can be enthralling regardless of the context, and certainly there is the intricate work in crafting the rule-bound bespoke design. These elements we can appreciate from afar, as an audience, whether we are also participants, or even just someone going through larp documentation, be it design documents (larp-as-designed), photographs, video, written reflections, or costumes (larp-as-remembered). The larp as played, for the participants, has three additional ways to encounter beauty. In larp, the participants mutually play a world into being by improvising within the rules and structures given by the design, partaking in emergent co-creation through play and inter-immersion. Furthermore, participants engage in vulnerable and generous play while being mindful, embodied, and present.

This game has been applied in different groups and its impact on students has been evaluated as a didactic resource when teaching Ancient History in general and the Iberian Peninsula in particular. During the 2018/19 academic year, a pilot test of the designed game has been carried out with nine groups of between 30 and 60 students and three of them have been taken as a sample, being surveyed about the activity through a questionnaire prepared by the teaching team. The results obtained from the pilot test through direct observation and the elaboration and use of a questionnaire raise a clear acceptance of the resource for practical classes, bringing the student closer to specific topics such as the economic and social processes of Ancient History of the Iberian Peninsula, and has led to an improvement in the understanding of these by students.","2022-03-30","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2022-10-30 01:42:07","2022-05-19 12:23:01","641-669","","","13","","","Iberia","","","","","","","es","info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","","","","gredos.usal.es","","Accepted: 2022-05-13T11:27:36Z Publisher: Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca (España)","","","","_rttp; _history; _peer reviewed; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The movie is divided into pieces like a common RPG session.

I found that Live Action Role Players (LARPers) consciously abandoned gender roles but were deeply invested in creating racial categories to make games “feel real.” When creativity is paramount, what makes for this differential treatment? I identified key distinctions in how these categories were conceived, embodied, and enforced. I found that LARPers engaged in collective negotiations to maintain a homogenous understanding of fictional racial categories. When players deviated, they were coerced back into uniform embodiment. These categories often drew on existing racial stereotypes, using “real world flavor.” When participants attempted anti-racist interventions, conversations shifted from confronting racism to “understanding race.” Conversely, LARPers framed gender as a self-determined choice that should have no impact on the gaming experience. Gender performance was welcome but not predetermined. This led to greater gender inclusion and effective anti-sexist interventions. Accordingly, the “both/and” framing of identity—authentic self-navigating society—is an empowering model for gender as it legitimizes autonomous choice. However, when applied to race it risks obfuscating the collective practices that fortify racism. Intersectional theorists must abandon efforts to draw similarities between race and gender. Instead, intersectional research must identify the ways in which sexism and racism persist and compound. The confrontation of racecraft is a necessary first step in developing more robust solutions.","2022-07-25","2022-09-21 16:11:06","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-08-02 20:03:33","","","0","0","","Sociology of Race and Ethnicity","Interventions in Intersectionality","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","_worldbuilding; _gender; _minority; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plot as a Common Ground Between Contemplative and Interactive Fictions","3rd ENN (European Narratology Network) Conference","","","","","Fieldwork in the production and reception of interactive fictions reveals a paradox: everybody uses the narratologist’s toolbox, but nobody wants to tell or be told stories. The interactive experience is rather described as a quest, an investigation, a negotiation, etc.  What these forms of experience share with storytelling lies upstream in the creative process. Moving one step backwards, scholars can study plot before narrative. By doing so, they can further the diversification of  narratology and at the same time consolidate contemplative and interactive fictions. Novels and videogames can be built on similar plot structures, but with specific features: exposition / complication / resolution in a novel; instructions / challenge / evaluation in a game.  Moreover, plot does not imply a top-down conception of communication. Narrator / narratee models can be replaced by intrigant / intriguee or riddler / riddlee patterns, but it is also interesting to see plot as a shared, author-free, object. Thus, interactivity is not merely a choice between existing storylines, but a co-construction of fictional events on a stage (improvisational theater), around a table (tabletop RPGs), in a real setting (live action RPGs) or online (MUDs, MMORPGs). These plot-based events are tellable, but seldom told.","2013-03-29","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-04 16:28:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","NarrNet / EHESS (CRAL)","Paris","","","","","","","","","","","","_plot structure; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Emerging Vectors of Narratology : Toward Consolidation or Diversification ?","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BHF4RIZE","book","2001","Ryan, Marie-Laure","Narrative as Virtual Reality: Immersion and Interactivity in Literature and Electronic Media","","978-0-8018-7753-7","","","","Is there a significant difference in attitude between immersion in a game and immersion in a movie or novel? What are the new possibilities for representation offered by the emerging technology of virtual reality? As Marie-Laure Ryan demonstrates in Narrative as Virtual Reality, the questions raised by new, interactive technologies have their precursors and echoes in pre-electronic literary and artistic traditions. Formerly a culture of immersive ideals—getting lost in a good book, for example—we are becoming, Ryan claims, a culture more concerned with interactivity. Approaching the idea of virtual reality as a metaphor for total art, Narrative as Virtual Reality applies the concepts of immersion and interactivity to develop a phenomenology of reading.  Ryan's analysis encompasses both traditional literary narratives and the new textual genres made possible by the electronic revolution of the past few years, such as hypertext, interactive movies and drama, digital installation art, and computer role-playing games. Interspersed among the book's chapters are several ""interludes"" that focus exclusively on either key literary texts that foreshadow what we now call ""virtual reality,"" including those of Baudelaire, Huysmans, Ignatius de Loyola, Calvino, and science-fiction author Neal Stephenson, or recent efforts to produce interactive art forms, like the hypertext ""novel"" Twelve Blue, by Michael Joyce, and I'm Your Man, an interactive movie. As Ryan considers the fate of traditional narrative patterns in digital culture, she revisits one of the central issues in modern literary theory—the opposition between a presumably passive reading that is taken over by the world a text represents and an active, deconstructive reading that imaginatively participates in the text's creation.","2001","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","","","352","","","","","","","","","","Johns Hopkins University Press","Baltimore, MD","en","","","","","Amazon","","","","","","_immersion; _storytelling; Buch; Elektronische Medien; Immersion; Leseverhalten; Multimedia; Narrativität; Virtuelle Realität; _escapism; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

""That's true of books and theater and radio drama and movies. It's true of games as well."" I have this argument all the time, and I think Goldberg's statement is balderdash. It's not true of music; music is pleasing sound, that's all. Yes, you can tell a story with music; ballads do that. So do many pop songs . Certainly some types of music -- opera, ballet, the musical -- are ""story-telling musical forms,"" but music itself is not a story-telling medium. The pleasure people derive from music is not dependent on its ability to tell stories: Tell me the story of The Brandenberg Concertoes. Nor is gaming a storytelling medium. The pleasure people derive from games is not dependent on their ability to tell stories.  The idea that games have something to do with stories has such a hold on designers' and gamers' imagination that it probably can't be expunged, but it deserves at least to be challenged. Game designers need to understand that gaming is not inherently a storytelling medium any more than is music--and that this is not a flaw, that our field is not intrinsically inferior to, say, film, merely because movies are better at story-telling. Nevertheless, there are games that tell stories--roleplaying games and graphic adventures among others -- and the intersection of game and story, the places where the two (often awkwardly) meet has bred a wide variety of interesting game styles. Examining them is useful, because doing so illuminates the differences between game and story -- and the ways in which stories can be used to strengthen (and sometimes hinder) games.","2000","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 01:50:53","2015-05-12 16:23:21","44–53","","9","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_story vs game; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Si ces craintes restent infondées, on peut toutefois s'interroger sur les raisons de l'attrait exercé sur la jeunesse par ces pratiques. Leur succès s'explique en fait par une variété, une complexité et une modernité insoupçonnée de prime abord. Ces qualités permettent aux individus recouverts sous le terme générique de «jeunes» une large palette de réappropriations symboliques et pratiques de ces objets. La diffusion de ces loisirs ne témoigne donc pas de l'émergence ou de la perpétuation d'une culture «jeune», mais révèle la diversité des statuts et des rapports au réel de chacun. Le refus de la culture légitime par une large part de ce public ne serait-il pas lié à l'impossibilité pour un bon nombre de se réapproprier des œuvres trop marquées socialement? Over the past twenty years, new forms of games for youth have raised numerous ideological and medical concerns. While these fears may be unfounded, we should, however, ask ourselves why young people are so attracted to these activities. Their success can, in fact, be explained by their initially unexpected variety, complexity and modernity. These qualities provide the group of individuals referred to as “youth” with a wide range of symbolic and practical appropriations. The popularity of these leisure activities is therefore not a sign of the emergence or the perpetuation of a “youth” culture, but reveals the games' diversity in adapting to each person's reality. Could the reason that a large part of this group denies legitimate culture not be linked to the fact that for many of them, it is impossible to adopt practices that are too socially stigmatized?","1994","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 01:41:53","2015-05-14 20:57:40","25-50","","1","17","","","Role-playing, Video Games, Interactive Books: Investigation into a New Mass Culture","","","","","","","fr","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","QID: Q106980666","","","","_peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; =p0; _OTHER GAMES; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We can then use Genetic Algorithms to create the characters required by those stories. Through user interaction, we can dictate what kind of characters and stories should be created and the computer slowly converges to creating stories according to the users liking. With the implementation of this methodology, we can ensure that no two plays of the same game should give the user the same experience. With user input we can ensure that the Genetic Algorithm learns with every play-through thus creating stories and characters that are more according to the liking of the user.","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-07 18:16:03","2015-07-30 18:40:35","59–64","","","","","","","WASA '12","","","","ACM Digital Library","New York, NY","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","role-playing games; evolution; genetic algorithm; story creation; _plot structure; _procedural storytelling; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _character; =PM-lu; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interactive Drama changes the audience to a single User who enters that stage, interacting with the characters, and participating in the story. Computer-based interactive drama allows a User to interact with simulated worlds which are inhabited by dynamic and complex autonomous characters and shaped by a flexible, aesthetically pleasing story. Unlike the actions of characters in a play, the actions of the User are not controlled by the artist. The problem is to shape the User's experience to conform to the set of themes and ideas to be conveyed. This work proposes this problem can be solved by dynamically monitoring and subtly guiding the experience of the User. This dissertation describes an architecture called Moe that is designed to provide dramatic guidance. Moe uses abstract, adversary search with an aesthetic evaluation function to decide how and when to guide the User's experience. The first technical achievement of this work is a demonstration of the ability to capture a dramatic aesthetic (for one interactive drama) in an automated evaluation function that can examine an experience and determine its quality, much as a movie critic determines the quality of a film. This result is supported by statistically demonstrating a high degree of correlation (r =.87) between the evaluation function and the human artist. The second main technical achievement of this work is the implementation of three such strategies (SAS and SAS+, both based on random sampling; and MMFC, which uses memoization to implement a full-depth search) and a search state that seem capable of effectively modelling and guiding an interactive dramatic experience. Moe has not yet been connected to a running interactive experience, but instead Moe has been tested with a variety of Simulated User Types. On ""average"" Users, SAS, SAS+, and MMFC are able to improve Users' experiences from the 50th percentile, to the 94th, 98th, and 99th percentile, respectively. This is a large and artistically meaningful increase. This dissertation describes the first implementation of a system designed to provide centralized dramatic guidance in an interactive drama.","1997","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-07-30 17:50:41","","204","","","","","","","","","","Carnegie Mellon University","Pittsburgh, PA","en","","PhD Computer Science","","","","ISBN 0-591-52286-1","Chairs: 	Joseph Bates","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advantages of the system include being able to produce a large number of different but tactically similar adventure modules with substantial control of content and feel by the designer. In addition to presenting a modified version of the map generator, the system presented in this study also automatically identifies rooms, abstracts the room adjacency relation, and populates the rooms with monsters, traps, and treasure.

This book provides an introduction to various game research methods that are useful to students in all levels of higher education covering both quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. In addition, approaches using game development for research is described. Each method is described in its own chapter by a researcher with practical experience of applying the method to topic of games. Through this, the book provides an overview of research methods that enable us to better our understanding on games.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2015-08-12 20:30:49","","373","","","","","Game Research Methods","","","","","ETC Press","Pittsburgh, PA","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES","","Lankoski, Patri; Björk, Staffan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L’antagonisme avec ce dernier terme est tout particulièrement souligné par Henriot dans son ouvrage de 1969 sur le jeu. Or, si toute société s’adosse à une conception du sacré qui lui est spécifique, on doit en déduire que l’extension du ludique dans les sociétés contemporaines implique une transformation radicale du rapport au sacré, et donc une transformation tout aussi radicale du sociale dans son entier.

Often overshadowed by video games or confused with tabletop role-playing games, these recently developed games remain overlooked by most scholars, although they provide ideal observation conditions and new research avenues for narratologists and interactivity theorists. Since the publication of Once Upon a Time (1994), dozens of games have enriched the diversity of available narrative traditions in this field: fairy tales, horror B-movies (Polar Base), historical drama (Montségur 1244) or the Coen brothers’ universe (Fiasco). As a product, a storygame does not display any narrative, but provides rules and tools (dice, cards, blank forms) that can generate a continuously renewed narrative production. This is why the issue of how knowledge is mobilized during storygame sessions is crucial to the ethnographic study of the links between narration and interactivity. Collective encyclopedias – in Umberto Eco’s sense – allow the sharing and the development of a plot, on the basis of sparse diegetic information, in “rotating narrator” devices where interpretative cooperation failures often lead to in-game conflict.","2014","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-11 20:18:03","2015-09-16 20:08:47","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","Paris","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_story vs game; _storytelling; _storygame; _improvisation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the case of “sports videogames,” this article advocates a critical and located approach to understanding videogames and gameplay. Unlike many existing theorizations of gameplay, such as the “magic circle,” which theorize play as a break from ordinary life, this article argues for a consideration of play as a continuation of “the control of the established order.” It argues that many videogames, and in particular sports videogames, can be understood as “themed” spaces which share similarities to other themed locations, such as fast-food restaurants and theme parks. These are “nonplaces” themed to provide a sense of individuality, control, and escape in a society that increasingly offers none.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 02:48:22","2015-10-19 13:24:05","571-592","","6","10","","Games and Culture","Is it in the Game?","","","","","","","en","","","","","gac.sagepub.com","","QID: Q56017515","","","","games; Play; hyperreality; Lefebvre; Marxism; space; sports; themes; theming; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM-lu; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of our tabletop handheld augmented reality (THAR) games research, in which computer graphics content is rendered and registered on top of the players’ view of the physical world, we are motivated to understand how social play unfolds in board games with the purpose of informing design decisions for THAR games. In this paper we report an empirical study of recorded video from a series of board game play sessions. We present five categories of social interactions based on how each interaction is initiated, among which we believe that the category of “chores” (interactions arising from the bookkeeping activities required to maintain and update game state) provides opportunities and support for four other kinds of social interaction, namely, “Reflection on Gameplay” (reacting to and reflecting on gameplay after a move); “Strategies” (deciding how to play before a move); “Out-of-game” (reacting to and talking about out-of-game subjects); and “Game itself” (commenting on and reacting to the game as an artifact of interest). We note that “chores” in board games (e.g. waiting for a turn, rule learning and enforcement, maneuvering physical objects), which at first appear to be merely functional, are critical for supporting players’ engagement with each other. Although most of these chores can be automated using technology, we argue that this is often not the best choice when designing social interactions with digital media. Based on our experience with THAR games, we discuss several design choices related to “chores”. To understand the connection between game design elements and social experience, we apply Interaction Ritual (IR) theory from micro-sociology to interpret our data.","2011","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-13 01:48:24","","","","","","","","Chores Are Fun","","","","","Utrecht School of the Arts","","","","","","","","","","","","","_virtual table; _typology; _playfulness; _metagame; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM-lu; _OTHER GAMES; =PM-obsidianized; _DESIGN; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DiGRA '11 - Proceedings of the 2011 DiGRA International Conference: Think Design Play","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"W7REW22X","bookSection","2004","Juul, Jesper","Introduction to Game Time","First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game","0-262-23232-4","","","","The third book in a multivolume series dedicated to the critical study of the virtual worlds of video game narrative and story. Third Person examines vast narratives across diverse media ranging from comic books to television and video games to literature. Electronic games have established a huge international market, significantly outselling non-digital games; people spend more money on The Sims than on ""Monopoly"" or even on ""Magic: the Gathering."" Yet it is widely believed that the market for electronic literature -- predicted by some to be the future of the written word -- languishes. Even bestselling author Stephen King achieved disappointing results with his online publication of ""Riding the Bullet"" and ""The Plant."" Isn't it possible, though, that many hugely successful computer games -- those that depend on or at least utilize storytelling conventions of narrative, character, and theme -- can be seen as examples of electronic literature? And isn't it likely that the truly significant new forms of electronic literature will prove to be (like games) so deeply interactive and procedural that it would be impossible to present them as paper-like ""e-books""? The editors of First Person have gathered a remarkably diverse group of new media theorists and practitioners to consider the relationship between ""story"" and ""game,"" as well as the new kinds of artistic creation (literary, performative, playful) that have become possible in the digital environment. This landmark collection is organized as a series of discussions among creators and theorists; each section includes three presentations, with each presentation followed by two responses. Topics considered range from ""Cyberdrama"" to ""Ludology"" (the study of games), to ""The Pixel/The Line"" to ""Beyond Chat."" The conversational structure inspired contributors to revise, update, and expand their presentations as they prepared them for the book, and the panel discussions have overflowed into a First Person web site (created in conjunction with the online journal Electronic Book Review).","2004","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:51:34","","131-142","","","1","3","","","","","","","The MIT Press","Cambridge, MA","en","","","","","Primo","GV1469.17.S63","","","","","Electronic games Social aspects.; Jeux électroniques Aspect social.; _storygame; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _DESIGN","","Wardrip-Fruin, Noah; Harrigan, Pat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Augmenting the table-top role-playing games (TTRPG) by adding electronic devices is a growing research area, yet the introduction of new play styles is still open for exploration. We believe that integration of wearable devices and movement-based play, which are also prominent research areas for gaming, hold potential for increasing the TTRPG experience since these are observed to increase the connectedness of players to imaginary world of games by previous studies. However, such augmentation will also bring changes in game design and these changes were not investigated thorougly in previous studies. To understand how game design of such games may change due to the usage of wearables and movement-based play, we conducted a participatory design workshop with (1) 25 participants, (2) designed a new game system according to our findings and (3) evaluated it with iterative tests with 15 participants in TTRPG sessions. Our study resulted in 8 player-centered game design implications for the use of arm-worn devices and movment-based play in narrative based long-term games like TTRPG. The implications present clues about forming the narrative, regulating the rules and the functional use of the device in game mechanics.","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2016-11-25 16:35:41","403–412","","","","","","WEARPG","AcademicMindtrek '16","","","","ACM","Tampere","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","Role Playing Games; augmented games; exertion games; Guidelines; play test; player experience; Table-Top; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _DESIGN; _ux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the success of Go playing programs, it is clear great strides have been made in these areas. In language and broad reasoning, the Watson program was able to beat human experts in Jeopardy! In this article we look at some of the successes of current cognitive architectures on these games.

"CLSP2IYM","thesis","2016","Cavanaugh, Patrick","Machine Learning for Game Master Recommender","","","","","https://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/1785398287/abstract/C78AFEE5079444BAPQ/6","Artificial Intelligence and specifically Machine Learning has been put to use for years in the context of virtualizing board games. However, most of the current uses are typically applied to representing individual players or in-game agents; resolving tasks such as path finding or strategy. In the genre of more complex Role Playing Games there is another entity other than the normal player, the Game Master (GM). The GM’s role is to not only serve as controller of the player’s in-game adversaries, but also to construct the world, story, and scenarios the players are engaged in. It is not the goal of the Game Master to defeat the players (though this certainly can happen), but to create a challenging and fun experience for the players to engage in within the game’s rule set. It is the goal of this thesis to encapsulate the thought process of a GM when it comes to constructing the game regarding what types of scenarios to present to players next after a sequence of completed scenarios. This requires the very human process of reading players’ current engagement and attitude towards the previous sequence of scenarios in order to maximize their continued enjoyment. While previous studies have investigated altering games in real time to increase fun, these have all focused on manipulating the traits of the games’ Non Player Characters (NPCs) (such as speed or difficulty) or integrated this concept into procedurally generated level design for one player games. What is being proposed with the GM recommender system is capturing the human behavior of reading the moods of players and overall story design through scenarios to increase the “fun factor” of a group of players. It will act at the level referred to as the “meta-game” and determine what sort of scenarios that give the most enjoyment between combat, skill checks, and story components, as well as variables specific to each of those scenario types (such as difficulty).","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2017-11-29 14:55:31","","59","","","","","","","","","","University of Nebraska at Omaha","Omaha, NB","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.S.

By providing these improvements, they can increase the immersiveness and player/character relationship which are critical for an ideal TTRPG experience. To investigate this underexplored area, we conducted an extensive research through design process which includes a (1) participatory design workshop with 25 participants, (2) preliminary user tests with Wizard-of-Oz and experience prototypes with 15 participants, (3) production of a new game system, wearable and tangible artifacts and (4) summative user tests for understanding the effects on experience with 16 participants. As a result of our study, we extracted design guidelines about how to integrate wearables and movement in narrative-based tabletop games and communicate how the results of each phase affected our artifacts. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","Montreal","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","Guidelines; Role playing games; Exertion games; Game research; Tangible interfaces; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _DESIGN; _ux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on unobtrusive behavioral data captured by the game, combined with a large survey and traditional ethnographic methods, the study found that role players both negotiate identity and use their time online as a moratorium for their offline lives. Descriptive results showed that role players are a relatively small, but psycholo- gically burdened subgroup. When examined from the theoretical perspectives of Goffman’s Self-Presentation theory, Huizenga’s Magic Circle, and Turkle’s early work on online identity formation, these players were seen as largely using virtual spaces as creative outlets and for socialization. The worlds also functioned as coping mechanisms for players frequently unable to gain acceptance, social connectivity or social support offline due to their personal situation, psychological profile, or their minority status.","2011-03-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 02:06:13","2015-05-13 18:28:14","171-200","","2","6","","","Behind the Avatar","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","QID: Q114772192","","","","_playfulness; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first ‘adventure’ (a computer game genre that is paradigmatic for today’s game designs) started out as a simulation of cave exploration and today ‘caves, caverns and dungeons’ are still among the most used topics in game narration, artwork and design. From Tomb Raider to Uncharted, from The Bard’s Tale to World of Warcraft, the exploration of cave-like structures seems to be an integral part of a great number of games that were present from the beginning. In this chapter it is argued that there are intrinsic reasons why computer games maintain such a close relationship with speleological themes of all kinds.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2020-02-09 19:55:17","119-136","","","","","","Caves, Caverns and Dungeons","Performance Philosophy","","","","Palgrave Macmillan UK","London","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1057/978-1-137-59521-8_5","","","","_dungeon crawl; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg","","Rautzenberg, Markus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several authors from different fields have already mentioned the educational potential of role-playing games (RPG). As tabletop role-playing games (TRPG) present some similarities with small adult groups in learning and personal development situations, what about their transformative potential? Aim. The purpose of this article is to describe the tabletop role-playing game’s emerging context, a few of its specificities and functions, to show links with several education, play and game, and personal development theories, and to raise awareness about its transformative potential. Methods. Three complementary approaches were used: a literature review (academics and role-players), action-researches through a transformative role-playing game (“TF-RPG” – a TRPG plus a debriefing), and data cross-analysis. Results. Participants are involved in the TF-RPG through four levels of reality, namely the character, player, person, and human being, which can be associated with four dimensions of learning: knowing, doing, being, and relating. The unveiling of links between the TF-RPG experience and their personal journey offers the participants various ways of learning and paths towards personal development. Conclusion. TRPGs are particularly effective to foster knowledge acquisition, develop role-play skills, strengthen team building, encourage collaborative creativity, and explore one’s personal development.","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 01:52:36","2016-07-11 13:14:53","423-444","","4","47","","Simulation Gaming","","","","","","","","en","","","","1","sag.sagepub.com","","QID: Q107450236","","","https://doi.org/10.1177/1046878116650765","_major publication; _therapy; _attitude change; _canada; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _transformative; =cpi-bes2018; =rabbit; =blogged; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; =citation-alert:WOS; =PM-lu; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once play is positioned as a state of mind, activities that constitute work need not be disjunct from playful behavior. Yet for most workers, work is rarely if ever playful, and attempts to import play behavior into the workplace (‘gamification’) do not result in greater playfulness. Part of this problem results from specific aesthetic values for games having dominated both work and play. As Roger Caillois warned half a century ago, sport-like values have increasingly saturated the culture of the overdeveloped world. Meanwhile, gamification processes have only been able to export task-focussed reward structures from the domain of play – practices that descend from Dungeons & Dragons, but that have been denuded of their playful qualities. In parallel to the gamification of work has been the gamification of games, namely an increasing emphasis on tasks to structure video game play (e.g., achievements), and thus make them more compelling yet less playful. In so much as this entails forcing particular patterns of understanding onto both players and workers, this makes gamification a parallel to Jacques Rancière's stultification in education: a binding of wills instead of an emancipation. If we want a world where work could be more playful, we must begin by breaking the cultural dominance of sport-like and task-like aesthetics of play, and endeavour to overcome the underlying fears that prevent work from being played.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-18 01:03:25","2018-06-20 18:01:18","1193-1203","","9","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118x.2018.1450435","_gamification; _roleplayification; _dnd; _rpg theory; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cpi-bes2018; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =biblio:DNDP2018; =PM-lu; _OTHER GAMES; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The essay begins with an overview of role-playing practices in the context of what might be termed the “participatory turn” in performance and culture, providing examples tabletop and live action role-playing games. Goffman’s concept of “engrossment” (from his writings on games) is compared to Csikszentmihalyi’s notion of “flow” as applied to role-playing and emergent authorship. The relationship of character to role-play is also explored through Schechners “not me, not not me” paradox, in which a character is seen as a hybrid between the performer and the fictional entity. Finally, drawing on Goffman and Fine, I outline a series of sociological “frames” that describe the functions within role-playing, and conclude with further discussion of role-playing as it fits into the larger participatory turn in performance and culture.","2014-12-05","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2020-04-20 19:51:29","","","","1","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","New York, NY","en","","","","","Crossref","","DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199892921.013.27","","","","_theater; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Piekut, Benjamin; Lewis, George E.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a comprehensive study of the role of interplayer communication during the gaming process in digital and tabletop role-playing game formats. A series of empirical game experiments are presented and the player-based communication analyzed, with the aim of clarifying how format (media of expression) impacts on verbal communication in multiplayer games; as well as examining player communication in general. The results show distinct differences in the communication patterns between the two game formats, directly related to the limitations and requirements of the tabletop and digital media utilized, for example in the amount of “in-character” communication. Interplayer communication in both formats is highly focused on functional content, that is, oriented towards supporting practical gameplay; however, functional content has different meanings on the two platforms. These and other results are discussed in the context of format differences and in the larger context of the functions of verbal communication during the playing of multiplayer games.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 17:03:55","2015-07-30 18:42:25","56:1-56:36","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","Number: 4 QID: Q107104558","","","","_attitude change; _personality; _oral communication; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; _character; =biblio:DNDP2018; =PM-lu; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fantasy role-playing games (Dungeons & Dragons, Rolemaster, GURPS), while they may involve some of those aforementioned elements, rarely focus on them. Instead, playing a fantasy role-playing game is much like acting out a scene from a play, movie or book, only without a predefined script. Players take on such roles as wise wizards, noble knights, roguish sellswords, crafty hobbits, greedy dwarves, and anything else one can imagine and the referee allows. The players dont exactly compete; instead, they interact with each other and with the fantasy setting. The game is played orally with no game board, and although the referee usually has a Performance is a major part of role-playing, and role-playing games as a performing art is the subject of this book, which attempts to introduce an appreciation for the performance aesthetics of such games. The author provides the framework for a critical model useful in understanding the art--especially in terms of aesthetics--of role-playing games. The book also serves as a contribution to the beginnings of a body of criticism, theory, and aesthetics analysis of a mostly unrecognized and newly developing art form. There are four parts: the cultural structure, the extent to which the game relates to outside cultural elements; the formal structure, or the rules of the game; the social structure, which encompasses the degree and quality of social interaction among players; and theaesthetic structure, concerned with the emergence of role-playing as an art form.","2001","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","201","","","","","The fantasy role-playing game","","","","","McFarland","Jefferson, NC","en","","","","","Open WorldCat","","foreword by Brooks McNamara ; afterword by Marshall Blonsky. qid: Q106288443","","","","_major publication; _theater; _dnd; _TTRPG; _art; =blogged; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons). While both the organization B.A.D.D and its claims linking Role-playing games to youth suicide, drug use and Satanism eventually were discredited, the impact of these accusations lingers on to the present. This article examines the impact of the role-playing game ""moral panic"" on the role-playing game community and investigates the responses and coping mechanisms utilised by those directly targeted and harassed by churches, the police, schools and governments during the height of the ""moral panic"" in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

His inner life was not safely reachable by conventional therapy. After he became involved in playing a fantasy game, Dungeons and Dragons, the therapy was modified to use the game material as displaced, waking fantasy. This fantasy was used as a safe guide to help the patient learn to acknowledge and express his inner self in a safe and guided way. The patient ultimately matured and developed healthier object relations and a better life. The theoretical underpinnings of this process are explored, both in dynamic terms and in terms of the biologic correlation and equivalence of dreams and waking fantasy.

Après avoir esquissé l’origine et la cohérence des dispositions sociales qui se déploient dans la pratique (penchants au raisonnement, à l’abstraction, à l’évasion…), on montre que celle-ci peut être appréhendée comme un double espace de socialisation à la masculinité : le groupe de pairs où le mode de valorisation de soi repose sur des ressources mentales et culturelles spécifiques ; le cadre de la fiction qui fait place à l’expression imaginaire d’une virilité archétypale. On s’interroge alors sur le rapport des enquêtés à la masculinité dans les domaines de la scolarité, des relations amoureuses et amicales. Les difficultés qu’ils semblent rencontrer concernant l’affirmation de leur masculinité, en partie liées à des discordances dans le processus de socialisation, éclairent d’un nouveau jour l’engagement dans le jeu de rôles et font apparaître les fonctions d’évitement et de compensation qu’il est susceptible d’assurer.","2004","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 16:11:22","2015-04-30 19:18:57","43-67","","3","55","","","","","","","","","","fr","","","","","Cairn.info","","Number: 3 QID: Q114772234","","","","_identity; _gender; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =0.66; =cleaned; =french; =biblio:DNDP2018; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Il distingue trois principaux types de ressources : les connaissances, la sociabilité et les symboles identitaires. Ces ressources apparemment intangibles peuvent toutefois comprendre une dimension matérielle, comme l’accès à des lieux de pratique ou de réunion, des moyens de financement et de communication, ou la possibilité pour les membres de coordonner leur présence physique. Les organisations utilisent cette dimension matérielle pour contrôler l’accès aux ressources. Pour appréhender les modes d’organisation de loisirs sous cet angle, Fine mobilise trois enquêtes ethnographiques : sur Donjons et Dragons, l’un des premiers jeux de rôle commerciaux créé dans les années 1970; sur les championnats de baseball de la Little League; et sur les cueilleurs de champignons engagés dans des associations. Selon Fine, pour qu’un loisir puisse être apprécié, il est nécessaire que des ressources soient mises à disposition afin que chaque membre ait les moyens de tirer satisfaction de son engagement volontaire. Pour se démarquer de l’étude des motivations des participants, privilégiées par la psychologie sociale, Fine souligne le rôle de ressources matérielles dans les conduites étudiées. Le cas du jeu de rôle Donjons et Dragons illustre un format différent des deux autres : celui de l’organisation commerciale. Cette organisation engendre des «sous-cultures propriétaires» (Dayan, 1986), c’est-à-dire des pratiques de loisir fortement contraintes par les ressources commerciales mises à disposition des participants (manuels de règles officielles, supports de jeu, etc.). L’imposition de ressources commerciales dont l’usage est contraint par des licences légales contrôlées par l’entreprise instaure un rapport de pouvoir asymétrique en défaveur des usagers, freinant l’accès aux ressources.

Particular attention is given to developments within the justice system, the professions of psychology and psychiatry, and the waning of the Anti-Cult Movement to explain why the panic lost momentum. Other contributing factors are also discussed, including the weakening of Christian Fundamentalism as a force in society and the shift of attention of the mass media and the general public to other topics.

This essay is an exploration of the thesis that healing as a cultural process can be the product of the manipulation of a symbolic framework of meaning. In such a process, the central concepts are those of passivity, empowerment, and the creation of meaningful cultural metaphors for the causal illness/ state of mind (Young 1977, Kovel 1976). The essay focuses on one particular case from what might be characterised as a developing system. The western recreational activity of roleplaying has been in existence for little over ten years, and in its initial self-conceptualisation was a variation on traditional wargaming. Yet such has been the pace of its development that certain groups are consciously experimenting with its potential for healing along lines that parallel certain psychotherapies and indigenous healing systems. My case study focuses on one roleplayer, “Malori” (a pseudonym) and the way in which she employs her roleplaying and visualisation skills to assist her in dealing with a disabling endogenous depression. In doing so I seek to identify the essential elements of the process and the structural characteristics of certain roleplaying groups which allow the potential for healing to be present. In concentrating on the construction of personal symbols through the creation of roleplaying personas or “characters”, my analysis will essentially be a semiotic one.","1988","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:24:24","2015-05-01 18:42:24","18","","","","","","","","","","","Dept. of Prehistory & Anthropology, Australian National University","Canberra","en","","","","","","","","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","Lyon, Margo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Anthropology IV Honours, Medical Anthropology Seminar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The nature of table-top gaming is such that players evolve, grow and maintain a rule set that represents an imaginary world.

"P7BNV5P6","thesis","2000","Holcomb, Jack","Playing Popular Culture: A Folkloristic Perspective on Role-Playing Games and Gamers","","","","","","Since the mid-1970s role-playing games (RPGs) have become a significant part of the leisure repertoire of millions of Americans. These narrative games allow their players to create a sense of participation in items from the popular culture; this sense emulates the sense of communal re-creation, participation, and ownership created among performers of verbal art and their audiences in cultures with thriving primary oral traditions. Role-players achieve this sense of participation by recontextualizing popular genres and materials from movies, television, books, and comic books as games through a selective reading process and highly specialized rules. There are RPGs covering a wide variety of popular romantic source products and genres, and role-players have created a great many styles of play over the years, leading to a complex system of genres within the gaming community. Role-playing in action is a verbal, performative art, supported by several roles: the players (who create and enact characters within the game), the game master (who prepares and performs the worlds through which the characters journey), and the designer (who constructs the framework for game performance by creating rules and settings). Since the early 1990s, when women began to enter this historically male hobby in large numbers, role-players have become more self-conscious about the narrative nature of RPGs. In conjunction with this sense that RPGs are devices for storytelling, some gainers have developed the sense that their games can be powerful social instruments; this sense is perhaps buttressed by the marginal image gainers have in the eyes of many. Gainers are often perceived as nerds, psychologically unstable people, and even Satanists. Whatever socially transformative power RPGs might possess, however, tends to be subverted by their reliance on source products that reinforce the dominant cultural order, as well as by qualities of the games themselves. The most significant impact these games seem to currently have is in the development of shared authority, collaborative imagination, and cooperative action within individual gaming groups, and perhaps also within the gaming community as a whole.","2000","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","206","","","","","","","","","","University of Louisiana","Lafayette, LA","en","","PhD Folklore Studies","","","","","","","","","_fandom; _moral panic; _gender; _genre; _narrative authority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elle montre que les JdR mettent en place des dispositifs ludiques qui obligent les joueurs à co-générer un contenu fictionnel diégétique et narratif, selon le principe qui est nommé l’intercréativité. L’intercréativité propre aux JdR fusionne les actes de création et de réception de la fiction et met en crise le rapport de la littérature à l’écrit. Dans un premier temps, nous étudions la manière dont s’est élaboré le concept d’intercréativité tout au long de l’histoire des JdR. Ensuite, nous les intégrons à un ensemble dont ils sont un élément fondateur, la culture geek. Nous montrons que le JdR est un héritier des littératures de l’imaginaire et qu’il fait la jonction entre ces deux sphères. Les JdR y sont également envisagés comme des mondes fictionnels intercréés, précurseurs d’une part des univers partagés et des jeux vidéo RPG, et d’autre part de la systématisation des mondes fictionnels qui induisent une réception interactive. Dans notre troisième partie, nous expliquons en quoi l’intercréativité fictionnelle mise en place par le JdR est un processus narratif et littéraire, une expérience collective et immédiate de la création de la fiction par le langage oral. Nous nous penchons sur les spécificités narratives de ce médium. Nous montrons également comment ces outils de création fictionnelle dépassent, pour certains écrivains, le cadre des JdR pour déboucher sur une création littéraire classique. Enfin, nous abordons le ludique comme un ensemble de dispositifs qui obligent les joueuses à créer un contenu fictionnel ensemble, ce que nous nommons l’intercréativité. Le JdR accomplit une disruption et une systématisation du matériau fictionnel, dont la réorganisation narrative est la création des joueurs. Avec l’intercréativité, c’est un rapport dionysiaque à la littérature qui ressurgit, alors qu’il avait été annihilé par l’industrialisation.

Étude d'une communauté de joueurs de jeux de rôle parisiens","","","","","http://www.archipel.uqam.ca/2016/1/M9267.pdf","Notre intérêt de recherche porte sur la stigmatisation des sous-cultures par la société. Afin d'étudier le phénomène de l'étiquetage social, nous avons décidé d'étudier une sous-culture dépréciée: la sous-culture des rôlistes. En effet, nos recherches préliminaires nous ont amenée à constater que cette communauté est décriée de manière très virulente. Cependant, nous nous sommes posés la question à savoir pourquoi une telle opinion? Pourquoi ce passe-temps est-il dénigré? Ces jeunes sont-ils dangereux ou fous? Les jeux sont-ils vecteurs de pathologies? Pourquoi une telle mise à l'écart? Notre but, dans cette étude, est d'identifier la stigmatisation et l'étiquetage dont ils sont victime et d'en comprendre les mécanismes. Nous voulons savoir si les joueurs sont des jeunes comme les autres ou en dehors de la réalité, une sorte de jeunesse dégénérée en mal de socialisation. La mise en marge de cette sous-culture par la société est un phénomène complexe que nous analysons dans cette recherche. Afin de mieux comprendre ce que sont les jeux de rôle, nous effectuons un bref historique des courants littéraires qui ont façonné le jeu de rôle jusqu'à aujourd'hui dont, principalement, le courant de la Fantasy, puis nous expliquons ce qu'est ce jeu de rôle. Pour mener à bien notre recherche, nous nous appuyons sur une méthodologie qualitative. Nous effectuons, une observation participante auprès d'un groupe de joueurs parisiens afin de comprendre leur dynamique et celle des jeux. N'ayant jamais joué aux jeux, nous confrontons notre point de vue avant l'expérience et après, afin de saisir si les jeux sont effectivement répréhensibles. Puis, nous interrogeons des non-joueurs pour connaître leur opinion sur les jeux. Des entrevues avec les joueurs nous permettent enfin de confronter les opinions et de comprendre quelle est leur position vis à vis des accusations à leur encontre. Le cadre théorique de l'École de Chicago et de l'interactionnisme symbolique nous permet de développer les concepts de l'étiquetage et de la stigmatisation, notions sur lesquelles nous nous basons pour effectuer notre analyse. Nos principaux résultats sont que les joueurs, considérés comme « déracinés », sont des jeunes comme les autres, passionnés par un passe-temps surtout inconnu. L'opinion générale serait propagée par les médias, entraînant une panique morale. Nous observons ainsi deux attitudes des joueurs face à ceci: devenir une source d'information; ou bien, développer une stigmatisation auprès de leurs accusateurs. La stigmatisation et l'étiquetage sont donc les résultats d'une influence extérieure impalpable. Il nous est apparu que le stigmate apportant le stigmate, le cercle apparaît difficile à briser.","2006","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-09 02:50:56","2015-05-01 20:17:49","","203","","","","","La stigmatisation d'une sous-culture","","","","","Université du Québec à Montréal","Montréal, QC","fr","","MA Communication","","","","","","","","","_fandom; _moral panic; _canada; _stereotype; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =french; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In conjunction with the creation of Dungeons and Dragons (D & D) in 1974, the term 'role-playing game' has been used by gamers to specify a particular type of game that involves face-to-face interaction between a gamemaster and players with the intention of creating a narrative. Theorists of games often acknowledge D & D as a foundational text, but do not consider it a separate genre from games that involve the control of an avatar in a computer-mediated environment. However, that tabletop RPGs have not been replaced by computer games and that gaming communities continue to refer to them by separate terms suggests that there are generic differences at work. The purpose of this thesis is to begin a more detailed study of the RPG genre by examining specific examples from a D & D adventure. I build on the work of Fine and Mackay but offer perspectives from narrative, game, and rhetorical theory. While my own study must be limited in scope, I suggest a possible framework for future study of RPGs as a rhetorical genre. To establish this framework, I use Ryan's (2001) study of narrative as virtual reality to explain how RPGs are examples of texts that involve productive interactivity. In Ryan's terms, they combine elements of immersion and interactivity, and of narrative and game. I propose viewing RPGs as a system of frames based on Ryan's (1991) possible-worlds terminology and Cook-Gumperz's (1992) account of forms of talk in make-believe games. I define these frames in terms of their reference to a social sphere, a game sphere, and a narrative sphere. To explain the structure of the plot in RPGs, I compare them to Ryan's (2001) tree-diagram format for interactive texts and Aarseth's (1997) cybertext model. I conclude that none of these formats fits the RPG completely, and that it should be viewed as its own genre. Because.","2005","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-05-01 20:33:33","","122","","","","","Tabletop Role-Playing Games","","","","","North Carolina State University","Raleigh, NC","en","","MA English","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Informed by performance ethnographic practice and the spirit of these games, it is written as an adventurous journey into and encounter with these experiences based on participant observation, interviews with gaming professionals, an online questionnaire of 428 gamers, and series of interviews with female gamers. Ethnographically, this study documents the history and experiences of women in the culture of gaming. It presents profiles of a diversity of female gainers and explores historically the ways that women have established themselves as members of this culture and shaped this traditionally male dominated hobby. It also examines a multiplicity of opinions about and experiences of sexism, prejudice, and discrimination of women in gaming. While demonstrating the progress in the games and their culture to become more inclusive and welcoming to women, it shows there is still far to go. It also demonstrates how, despite the possibility and creative potential for gaming and its culture to imagine completely new social worlds, the same power dynamics and social structures are recreated in the games, groups, and culture. Psychologically, the study uses archetypal, relational, and pluralistic models of the self to demonstrate the complex imaginal relationship between self and character and the notion that role-playing games can be transformational liminoid spaces. The study explored the multiplicity of three participants, through a series of interviews, one series with the player, one interacting with each participant in role as one of their characters, and then a final series reflecting on the experience of the two previous interviews, the process, and the themes that were discussed. These interviews demonstrate three different relationships between self and character, as well as the ways that those imaginal relationships have impacted the lives of these women in powerful ways that reach beyond just fun and games.","2006","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-05-01 20:35:43","","325","","","","","","","","","","Miami University","Oxford, OH","en","","PhD Psychology","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","_gender; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","Social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, recreational role-playing games (e.g.: Advanced Dungeons & Dragons) are seen as precursors to computerized interactive narrative media (i.e. such as computerized text-based adventure games, Muds, CD-Roms, hypertext narratives, etc.). After a review of various conceptions of interactivity, play is put forward as the most productive metaphor to start thinking about narrative interactivity. Different aspects of role-playing games (social, ludic, ideologic, etc.) are then introduced, after which their historical filiation with computerized interactive media will be presented. Finally, a discussion of the new ways in which power and pleasure are articulated around the open text will be initiated, where it will be shown how role-playing games can contribute to that reflection.","1997","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:00:44","","","204","","","","","Playing (in) the text","","","","","Concordia University","Montréal, QC","fr","Copyright UMI - Dissertations Publishing 1997","MA Communication","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_authorship; _literature; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =french; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although only role-playing games written in English are considered, the approach taken to understand the structures of attention emergent in gaming is generalizable as a means of investigating the informal social and rhetorical aspects of other kinds of games. The textual and visual rhetorics of numerous games are examined as self-situating lessons for acquiring and focusing interest. The intrinsic gap between reading and following a rule is explored as a phenomenon mediated by rhetoric. Experienced players' reflections on styles and motives are translated into ratios in a grammar of rhetorical invention. Finally, the game designers are interviewed for their professional life histories relative to the development of particular games, and the matters they emphasize are read as configurations of cultural knowledge animated by personal rhetorical resources and heuristics.","2002","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-05-01 20:41:48","","210","","","","","Topologies of invention","","","","","Rice University","Houston, TX","en","","PhD Anthropology","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The media and conservative religious groups have largely perpetuated the stigma associated with this subculture.  This study takes a closer look at the stigma as seen from non-members and members of the sub-culture.  By introducing non-members to the culture we can see how their negative preconceptions changed to a greater amount of acceptance.  I found that with introduction, the negative image of role-playing games was reversed. Additionally I looked at the perceptions of experienced gamers and found that the group interaction is seen as the greatest benefit of being part of the sub-culture.","2002","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-07-22","","20","","","","","","","","","","Linfield College","McMinnville, OR","en","","Senior Research Paper in Social and Behavioral Science","","","","","innocent_eric@yahoo.com","","","","_fandom; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It focuses on origins, believing that what Tocqueville said of nations is also true of cultural phenomena such as games: “[T]hey all bear some marks of their origin; and the circumstances which accompanied their birth and contributed to their rise affect the whole term of their being” (Tocqueville 17). Dungeons and Dragons is primarily considered in terms of Max Weber’s discussion of the protestant ethic and the irrationality of rationality; concurrently, this article also demonstrates the utility of D&D as a means to explore any number of cultural and social questions.

This contribution is increasingly apparent as the gaming industry has diversified with the addition of collectible strategy games and other innovative products, as well as the recent advancements in videogame technology.    This book presents the most current research in fantasy games and examines the cultural and constructionist dimensions of fantasy gaming as a leisure activity. Each chapter investigates some social or behavioral aspect of fantasy gaming and provides insight into the cultural, linguistic, sociological, and psychological impact of games on both the individual and society. Section I discusses the intersection of fantasy and real-world scenarios and how the construction of a fantasy world is dialectically related to the construction of a gamer's social reality. Because the basic premise of fantasy gaming is the assumption of virtual identities, Section II looks at the relationship between gaming and various aspects of identity. The third and final section examines what the personal experiences of gamers can tell us about how humans experience reality.","2006","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","224","","","","","Gaming as Culture","","","","","McFarland","Jefferson, NC","en","","","","","Google Books","","qid: Q106359074","","","","_major publication; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _SOCIOLOGY","","Williams, J.

The art of these modules reveals a genre and period-specific set of aesthetic codes with distinct subcultural rules of application. In order to construct a sense of nostalgia, the cover art highlights the representation of adventurers, monsters, and dungeon environments within a unique visual style reminiscent of the early Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) aesthetic from the late 1970s and the early 1980s. The Advanced Adventures use nostalgia ideologically as a form of homage to early D&D, to assert the values of old-school gaming, and to chart a new direction for classic fantasy role-playing that challenges the style of play espoused by the current fourth edition of D&D (4E) published by Wizards of the Coast.","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:29:15","2015-05-05 20:35:01","441-470","","6","7","","Games and Culture","There and Back Again","","","","","","","en","","","","1","Web of Science","","Number: 6 WOS:000314540500003 qid: Q106319413","","","https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412012465004","_major publication; _literature; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; =citation-alert:WOS; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The significance of video games within our everyday lives has certainly been increased and shaped by new technologies and gaming patterns, including the rise of home-based games consoles, advances in mobile telephone technology, the rise in more 'sociable' forms of gaming, and of course the advent of the Internet. This book explores the opportunities, challenges and patterns of gameplay and sociality afforded by the Internet and online gaming. Bringing together a series of original essays from both leading and emerging academics in the field of game studies, many of which employ new empirical work and innovative theoretical approaches to gaming, this book considers key issues crucial to our understanding of online gaming and associated social relations, including: patterns of play, legal and copyright issues, player production, identity construction, gamer communities, communication, patterns of social exclusion and inclusion around religion, gender and disability, and future directions in online gaming""-- ""Over only a few decades, digital gaming has become a major global leisure activity that now rivals the movie and music sectors. Due to this increasingly widespread popularity, gaming has in recent years become the focus of increased academic interest and activity, but still little is know about those who play digital games.

In doing so, the book provides a key introduction to the study of gamers and the games they play, whilst also reflecting on the current debates and literatures surrounding the virtual world.","2011","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","201-223","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","New York, NY","en","","","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","_disability; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Crawford, Garry; Gosling, Victoria K; Light, Ben","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three features of jocular interaction are of particular relevance for understanding humor's position in communication: (1) Humorous interaction demands an immediate response from its listeners. (2) Humorous interaction typically allows its animator considerable role distance, so that the implications of a jocular remark can be denied. (3) Humorous interaction as a metaphorical construction contains dense layers of meaning, and these meanings give it a significance beyond its denotative import. These 3 components permit an examination of how social actors strategically employ humor in natural interaction to altercast others (and define themselves) and to redefine situations. This analysis is illustrated by data from a gossip session among 3 teenage females and data from a participant observation study of fantasy game players. It is concluded that the realization of humor as a technique by which identities and situations are negotiated shows that this topic is of primary interest to students of social interaction.

The malleability of this world, coupled with the RPGs' social aspect, parallels the socially constructed reality which usually surrounds us. In this paper I collect a series of impressions from a few roleplaying sessions during which different groups of players attempted to construct new realities. In this sense, I examine the shared creation of reality out of empty space, exploring the potential inherent in roleplaying as a metaphor for organizing. I look for non-standard view-points on organizing which emerge from these sessions, and examine the process itself, not trying to pinpoint any regularities, but rather seeking the unusual and the sublime.","2000","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:12:02","2015-05-13 18:40:25","71-86","","1","6","","Studies in Cultures, Organizations & Societies","Dreams of Time, Times of Dreams","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Number: 1 QID: Q107064570","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/10245280008523538","_conflict; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By taking the approach that narrative can be understood with games, but only by incorporating the dynamics of game play and by accepting that existing models of narrative must be modified, this paper examines the place of narrative within role-playing games. Narrative can be defined as a description of a series of events. The description that narrative represents is experienced by the players, in an individual and personal manner. The implications of this for familiar concepts such as story and text are examined, and definitions proposed for them in the role-playing game context. Each can be best understood as unique to each participant in the game. The result shows that existing theories can be applied to the gaming context, but only with significant modification. The definitions proposed also allow for an initial consideration of how narrative is constructed in role-playing games.","2009","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:10:50","2015-05-14 14:20:19","53–60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_narrative authority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Salience, or the probability of an identity being invoked in a given situation, is argued to have two causes, interactional commitment (embeddedness in an identity-related network) and affective commitment (emotional gratification derived from an identity), and to in turn result in identity-related behavior. This dissertation addresses three limitations of past research: the neglect of leisure identities, the operationalization of behavior as time spent in role rather than as specific types of behavior, and the failure to include all four identity theory concepts in a single study. Data were collected in July 1983 for 113 boys (aged 10 to 17) attending a camp devoted to Dungeons and Dragons gaming. Campers completed surveys administered each of the five days of camp. Factor analyses established scales of each concept, while path analyses determined the relationships among the concepts. The results indicate the importance of delineating among types of behavior; interactional commitment consistently affects social behaviors, while affective commitment consistently affects solitary behaviors. Both types of commitment affect materialistic behavior. Dividing the sample on such variables as age and the length of time one had been gaming indicates that involvement with social behavior occurs the longer one has been gaming; this can be seen as support for one's ability and inclination to role-make, the search for self-validation, and development within identities. Contrary to the theory, interactional commitment is seldom related to salience, and salience rarely affects behavior. Identity theorists studying adolescents are urged to consider the possibility that the salience hierarchy of teens and pre-teens may be so unstable or ill-formed that weak or anomalous findings with regard to salience may result.","1986","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","95","","","","","Social Psychological Causes and Consequences of Fantasy Gaming","","","","","Indiana University","Bloomington, IN","en","Copyright UMI - Dissertations Publishing 1986","PhD Sociology","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","_identity; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SHS; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"VSCUSLBA","journalArticle","2010","Punzalan, Maria Pamela","Gamers on Stage: Theatrical Elements in Role-playing Games","International Journal of the Humanities","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319177943_Gamers_on_stage_Theatrical_elements_in_role-playing_games","Typical definitions of games and gameplay discount the most integral part of the role-playing game: that fact that it is a game, and that gameplay is very much involved in the process of propelling the narrative forward. It also ignores the principal appeal of role-playing games; that is, the emulation of social drama through fictional situations, or the manifestation of the fundamental human inclination towards play. It can be said, therefore that participants in an RPG cannot simply be regarded as players, nor can they be viewed as passive consumers of a narrative through their control of a character, they are gamers, readers and storytelling agents all in one. Because they role-play, these individuals are immersed in the imaginary world of the RPG, becoming the characters that they control, performing the roles that have been assigned to them (or, in some cases, roles that the player decided to take for himself or herself) in a simulation that is less like writing out a part of a narrative and more like the acting out of a role in a dramatic text on stage. As such, it may be possible to say that the element of role-play in RPGs makes them, in a sense, theatrical. Exploring the commonalities between role-playing games and the act of role-play with theatre and stage performance presents one with the possibility of gaining a new perspective on both forms while taking their unique characteristics into account.","2010","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:18:20","","65-76","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 4 Pamela Punzalan is a lecturer at the Department of English in Ateneo de Manila University.

It is suggested that art therapy serves as a creative tool in which adolescents can express feelings and issues crucial to their recovery. The art process further aids adolescents in developing their sense of identity and self-esteem, as well as preserving their autonomy by giving them a sense of mastery and control.

Drawing on SCHUTZian accounts of intersubjectivity and communication we understand maps as one of many strategies to deal with the problem of ""medium transcendencies"" posed by communicating with others. The methodology of ""sociological hermeneutics"" (SOEFFNER) is introduced as means of approaching maps and the interactions they are involved in. In our analyses of maps used in role-playing games we can then show that maps are not only a means of locating oneself but also a means of actively creating a meaningful place in which we are entangled. Thus, maps help to form a sense of belonging in (imaginary) territories which are only given to us in mediated form.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:07:18","2015-05-14 14:47:17","26","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 3","","","","_literature; _map; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Findings – Many options are available to libraries wishing to provide support for fantasy role-playing game programming. While an overwhelming quantity of publications are often available for purchase, usually only a bare minimum is required to run a role-playing game. Free or modestly priced options are available for libraries on a shoestring budget. Libraries interested in supporting fantasy role-playing game programming with collections need not spend much.

Consequently, role-playing games obligate participants to occupy a liminal role located in the boundaries of persona, player, and person. This study, based on approximately ninety hours of participant observation and forty interviews with thirty role-players, explores how role-players actively negotiate these symbolic boundaries: how role-players carve out distinct spheres of meaning between themselves, their fantasy personas, and status as players of these games. It also illustrates how these distinctions fail. Boundaries erupt and role-players prove unable to compartmentalize themselves so discretely. Through the lens of these games, we can examine simplified and exaggerated dynamics and entertain the possibility that we are all players located at the liminal margins between the people we believe ourselves to be and the personas we perform in situated social encounters.","2004","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:26:40","2015-05-14 15:08:40","333-356","","3","27","","Symbolic Interaction","Role-Playing and Playing Roles","","","","","","","en","Copyright © 2004 Wiley","","","10","Web of Science","","Number: 3 WOS:000223387100003 qid: Q55896243","","","https://doi.org/10.1525/si.2004.27.3.333","_gender; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _SOCIOLOGY","body; cybersex","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Schick, a succesful game designer himself, succinctly defines these paper or ""table-top"" games as ""quantified interactive storytelling."" The reference guide proper is preceded by two informative sections, ""What is a Role-Playing Game?"" and ""The History of Role-Playing Games."" The game descriptions are divided into 22 genres (and subgenres), and include fantasy (by far the most numerous), science fiction, comic book superheroes, espionage, and westerns. Each section begins with a brief descriptive overview and Schick's list of recommended games for that genre. Entries are also interspersed with brief essays and comments from designers concerning their games and their ideas about role-playing games in general. The game descriptions are supplemented by a directory of game publishers, a list of award-winning games, definitions of terms, a timeline, and a title index. Although very well written and well organized, this work is not a needed addition for most academic libraries, being recommended only for strong popular culture or games and recreation collections. --R.

"CL66AV8D","book","2012","","Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy: Raiding the Temple of Wisdom","","978-0-8126-9796-4","","","","This volume will convince readers that the swift ascent of the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons to worldwide popularity in the 1970s and 1980s is ""the most exciting event in popular culture since the invention of the motion picture."" Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy presents twenty-one chapters by different writers, all D&D aficionados but with starkly different insights and points of view.  It will be appreciated by thoughtful fans of the game, including both those in their thirties, forties, and fifties who have rediscovered the pastime they loved as teenagers and the new teenage and college-student D&D players who have grown up with gaming via computer and console games and are now turning to D&D as a richer, fuller gaming experience. The book is divided into three parts. The first, ""Heroic Tier: The Ethical Dungeon-Crawler,"" explores what D&D has to teach us about ethics and about how results from the philosophical study of morality can enrich and transform the game itself. Authors argue that it's okay to play evil characters, criticize the traditional and new systems of moral alignment, and (from the perspective of those who love the game) tackle head-on the recurring worries about whether the game has problems with gender and racial stereotypes. Readers of Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy will become better players, better thinkers, better dungeon-masters, and better people. Part II, ""Paragon Tier: Planes of Existence,"" arouses a new sense of wonder about both the real world and the collaborative world game players create. Authors look at such metaphysical questions as what separates magic from science, how we express the inexpressible through collaborative storytelling, and what the objects that populate Dungeons and Dragons worlds can teach us about the equally fantastic objects that surround us in the real world. The third part, ""Epic Tier: Leveling Up,"" is at the crossroads of philosophy and the exciting new field of Game Studies. The writers investigate what makes a game a game, whether D&D players are artists producing works of art, whether D&D (as one of its inventors claimed) could operate entirely without rules, how we can overcome the philosophical divide between game and story, and what types of minds take part in D&D.","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","288","","","","","Dungeons and Dragons and Philosophy","","","","","Open Court","Chicago, IL","en","","","","","Amazon","","","","","","_philosophy; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","Cogburn, Jon; Silcox, Mark","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cette pratique consiste en un dialogue entre plusieurs personnes qui incarnent, sous la direction d'un meneur de jeu, des rôles dans une aventure ou une certaine situation. Elle s'est beaucoup développée en France depuis quelques années, mais des idées reçues à son propos ont toujours assombri son image. De tragiques incidents et la manière dont ils ont été décrits ont amplifié le phénomène et beaucoup se demandent à présent si le Jeu de Rôle n'est pas nuisible à la santé mentale de ceux qui le pratique. Une telle accusation n'a pu que stupéfier les joueurs pour lesquels une quelconque influence néfaste est inimaginable. Il leur paraît impensable que les problèmes évoqués soient dûs au Jeu de Rôle et que les gens puissent le croire. Il nous a donc semblé indispensable de réagir face aux interprétations insensées que beaucoup dégagent, le plus souvent à cause d'une mauvaise information. Après une présentation des Jeux de Rôle, il sera nécessaire de s'intéresser aux reproches qu' on leur fait et aux réponses que l'on peut donner à toutes les accusations dont ils sont la cible. On pourra alors montrer l'intérêt et les bénéfices de la pratique de tels jeux.","1995","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:00:44","2015-07-23 13:49:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","fr","","Mémoire de techniques d'expression","","","","","","","","","_escapism; _de-roling; _moral panic; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =french; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In their eclectic cannibalization of various cultural others, these games instantiate the forms of late capitalist, postmodern culture. Nature plays an important part in this exotic simulacrum. Within fantastic worlds, druids, rangers, and other natureoriented characters engage a multitude of animals, monsters and humanoid creatures, as described in the animal catalogue of the Monster Manual. This bestiary pairs an assortment of exotic images with a rigorously quantified set of biopolitical rules. Through violently mastering this state of “bare life,” player-characters can advance in prestige and power. The proliferation of hybrid creatures means, however, that the “human” is not uniquely privileged—thus provoking the question of the position of the “animal” amid this seemingly subversive mélange of monstrosity.","2006","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:23:14","","135-168","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","en","","","MLA International Bibliography","53741834; 2006298066","","","Number: 1","","","","_literature; _dnd; _monster; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A partir d’une étude du secteur américain du jeu de rôle, nous montrons que l’introduction d’un système ouvert dans un secteur baisse les barrières à l’entrée et que les nouveaux entrants adoptent majoritairement ce système.

More specifically, it applies methods of literary analysis to the study of two narrative activities situated near the border of reading and gaming: Electronic hyperfictions and role-playing games. Miller first reviews literary theories of reader response and interactivity and notes how these have informed recent critical discussions of literary hyperfiction. He then critiques these discussions and the claims made for hyperfiction's liberating or empowering effect on readers: Contrary to the claims of some critics, such narratives generally fail to fulfill these promises and are, in fact, in many ways less interactive than traditional print fictions. The author then approaches the border between gaming and reading from the other direction, by examining a form of gaming that resembles reading in interesting ways: Role-playing games. Miller explores how reader response theories apply to analyzing the effects and meanings of such games, concluding that role-playing games provide a better model for the reification of reader response theories, albeit in a medium which is more oral than written, than do the hyperfictions which have received more serious attention from literary theorists. As such, role-playing games offer a potential medium for more truly interactive fiction that ""serious"" authors have yet to explore. Raising questions of textuality and its relation to games, Miller argues for the inclusion of games in contemporary literary studies and shows how fruitful such studies may be for our understanding of ""new media"" possibilities.","2006","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:26:35","","","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","MLA International Bibliography","53622130; 2007391951","","","Number: 1","","","","_literature; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"4TQMCSY2","book","2001","Edwards, Ron","GNS and Other Matters of Role-playing Theory","","","","","","My straightforward observation of the activity of role-playing is that many participants do not enjoy it very much. Most role-players I encounter are tired, bitter, and frustrated. My goal in this writing is to provide vocabulary and perspective that enable people to articulate what they want and like out of the activity, and to understand what to look for both in other people and in game design to achieve their goals. The person who is entirely satisfied with his or her role-playing experiences is not my target audience. Everything in this document is nothing more nor less than ""What Ron Thinks."" It is not an official Dogma for the Forge. It is not a consensus view of members of the Forge, nor is it a committee effort of any kind. It is most especially not an expectation for what you're supposed to think or believe. However, it does stand as the single coherent body of theory about role-playing at the Forge, and its lexicon is definitive for purposes of discussion there. I am satisfied with it, but I'm not unreasonable either, so it is not immutable. Please deal with it in one of the following ways: identify an inconsistency, ask for clarification and examples, or otherwise address its content critically. I am perfectly willing to amend any content, if I'm given a substantive reason to do so, and to give credit for the insight. I request that all discussion of this material be based on careful consideration. Snap judgments, unsupported value judgments, neophobia, taking offense, and other juvenile reactions are not welcome. Furthermore, I am well aware that my GNS notions vary greatly from the original Threefold Model (or GDS), and that my categories of Stance differs from those originally proposed. Identifying these differences does not constitute a criticism. I have been extensively influenced by the work of others and have incorporated it in ways which make sense to me. Concepts that were originated and developed by others are credited in the acknowledgments at the end.","2001","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","Adept Press","Brea, CA","","","","","","","","","","","","_rpg theory; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Medievalism examines how different groups, individuals, or eras use and shape the image of the Middle Ages, differentiating between historical knowledge of the Middle Ages and what we have made the period out to be. The 13 essays in this book explore the medieval invasion of today's media and consider the various ways--from film and print to websites and video games--that the Middle Ages have been packaged for consumption. Essays encompass diverse theoretical perspectives and are grouped loosely around distinct functions of medievalism, including the exposure of recent social concerns; the use of medieval images in modern political contexts; and the medieval's influence on products of today's popular culture. The legitimization of the study of medievalism and the effect of medievalism on the more traditional subject of medieval studies are also discussed.","2007","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","171-185","","","","","","","","","","","McFarland","Jefferson, NC","en","","","MLA International Bibliography","742318403; 2007390542","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: LroNNbbvcBoC","","","","_literature; _worldbuilding; _dnd; _neomedievalism; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RPGs have been translated into all media formats, and are also a rare example of functioning interactive narratives. Despite the popularity of these games, especially within computer games, and the possibility that experiences from RPGs could be used in designing interactive storytelling systems for next generation interactive entertainment systems, there have been very few academic studies focused on cross-platform studies of role playing games. In this paper, the results of a comparative analysis of pen and paper RPGs and computer RPGs, using an information systems perspective coupled with games analysis, is presented. The differences of the two game forms revolve around the different media formats and the limitations these impose and the options they provide. The formation of the collaborative story is a core feature of these games. While the formation of the storyline in multiplayer RPGs are complex, it appears that information systems modeling of multiplayer RPG story and control processes enables quantifiable modeling of an interactive storytelling systems.","2006","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:11:06","2015-07-30 16:10:40","75–82","","","","","","Role Playing Games","IE '06","","","","ACM Digital Library","Perth","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","_TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Diverse Approaches and Converging Goals","978-88-7587-698-2","","","","Massive Multi-Player Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) and Multi-User Domain Games (MUDs) are the most popular genre of PC games. In recent years there is a growing interest whether this type of Internet use, represents an ""addiction"". We recruited 22 former players (14 players of Internet and 8 players of pen and paper Role Playing Games - RPGs; mean age 27 +/- 5years who had succeeded to cut back the game without external help. We tried to describe players' perceptions of their previous ""addiction"" and compare their views. The study data was collected through personal interviews. Semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed and subjected to qualitative content analysis. Based on the results, the players' expressed various perceptions, which constituted five categories: games' particular characteristics, negative effects and positive effects on players' lives, possible causes for their behavior, and future intentions. Significant differences were noted in players' perceptions between the two groups. For Internet users content analysis revealed the same basic problems: irritability, social life neglect, and disruption of relationships, sleep deprivation, school or university failure, and loss of interest in other activities. Younger players reported even more problems. Overall, Internet players attributed their problems to an ""addictive dynamic"". None of these problems existed in players of pen and paper RPGs. Those players reported feelings of satisfaction, pleasure, improved social interactions and friendship connected to the game. Four players who were adolescents, all former Internet players, characterized their previous Internet use as an ""addiction"". They were seeing their problems as more serious and disruptive for their lives. In conclusion, the majority of internet players recognize the ""addictive dynamic"" of the game, but they do not necessarily consider themselves as ""addicted"". They characterize their Internet use and its consequences as a ""choice""; time loss and difficulty breaking off from the game were the more serious problems faced mainly by Internet players. It should be noted, however, that in contrast to clearly ""addicted players"", the players of this study were all able to overcome their psychological and behavioral problems without any external help after successful cessation of the Internet use.","2014","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","59-64","","","","","","","","","","","Medimond International Proceedings","Athens","en","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000343669700013","","","","_moral panic; _TTRPG; _belonging; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _HISTORYOFRPG","","Soldatos, C.; Ruiz, P.; Dikeos, D.; Riba, M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WPA Thematic Conference on Intersectional Collaboration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Role-playing in its traditional form is a complex activity including a game system and a number of communicative conventions where one player takes the role of the game manager in order to implement the rules and provide a world for the other players. In online role-playing games, a programmed system simulates the rule system as well as part of the game manager's tasks, while the rest of the activity is up to the players to define. Some aspects may translate more or less unproblematically across media, others are transformed by the introduction of the programmed system. This reveals some important perspectives on the sort of rules that can be simulated in a programmed system and what this means to the concept of rules in game studies.","2013","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-18 01:17:05","","371-391","","6","8","","Games Cult.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Web of Science","","Number: 6 WOS:000329661300001 QID: Q114731369","","","","_GMing; _dnd; _mechanics; _metagame; _game studies; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; _character; =biblio:DNDP2018; _computer rpg; _MEDIA; _GAMEPLAY","media studies; role-playing; communication; gameplay; game rules","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, tabletop RPGs have formed the statistical, and sometimes creative, basis for many of the most popular role-playing video games to date, so why is it that tabletop RPGs have been largely neglected in favor of the video game variety? This study takes a close look at how one particular group of players of Dungeons & Dragons engages the game as both a game and as an act of narrative creation. Their interactions can reveal something about how storytelling has changed in response to changes in technology and how this contributes to learning within various domains. In conducting this study, the author observed the group play and also became a participant in the experience to better understand how this group functions. Observation and interaction with these players show that they create stories that are not confined by the traditional boundaries of narrative, such as having a beginning, middle, and end. These stories are not confined to a single method of communication; the group takes advantage of music, films, objects, and even an online forum to expand their narratives across multiple media. The members of this group collectively and actively write their stories, all the while remaining aware that they are in fact creating a story. They challenge each other to improve and collectively work to become better, smarter role-players and narrative writers.","2010","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-05-15 18:33:49","","115","","","","","","","","","","University of Missouri-Columbia","Columbia, MO","en","OpenAccess.","MA in English","","","mospace.umsystem.edu","","Accepted: 2010-08-03T19:18:04Z DOI: 10.32469/10355/8065","","","","_writing; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although D&D may appear to be a game of simple make-believe, the emotions, camaraderie, and accomplishments experienced by players are real, thus suggesting that RPGs have real-world implications for players. Therefore, the goal of this study is to explore the ways in which players fulfill social needs through group communication during the context of D&D table-top role-play. Utilizing Bormann's (1972) fantasy theme analysis, this study uses a case study approach to identify four themes which emerged within player talk on Facebook: (1) democratic ideologies; (2) friendship maintenance; (3) extraordinary experiences; and (4) good versus evil. Findings provide a description of group members' real-world needs met through symbolic in-game interactions evidenced by communicative markers.","2013","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:25:23","","69-86","","6","12","","","Needs Met Through Role-Playing Games","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","Number: 1","","","","_creativity; _personality; _fandom; _group dynamics; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _belonging; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY; _MEDIA; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas previously “space was treated as static, neutral, transparent, and hence theoretically uninteresting,” many theorists have begun to explore the constructed nature of both space and place, the relationship between the two, and the relationship of both to issues of power and identity (Feld and Basso 1996; Lefebvre 1976; Soja 1980; Tuan 1977).  It is perhaps ironic that in game studies, where the spaces are more obviously constructed, little seems to have been written about the ways and ends to which players create and sustain imaginary spaces.  In this paper I explore the creation of space in Dungeons & Dragons, a case study I consider in the context of Gabbert's (2007) study of McCall, Iowa and Basso's (1996) study of the Western Apache.  Aligning these three studies allows each of them to nuance and illuminate one another, creating a complex picture of the human experience of space and place.","2011-11-16","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2015-05-15 18:40:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Montréal, QC","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Traces, Tidemarks and Legacies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lack of methodologies and design tools seems to be problematic for the eLearning companies and training departments placed in charge of learning game projects. In this context, we have focused in particular on the design of scenarios for Learning Role-Playing Games or LRPG because of their ability to suit to needs identified. This article presents the main characteristics of our work. Our aim is to guide designers in the choices they make, in particular when it comes to the use of tailored game principles, to help them formalise and justify their choices in relation with the project specifications and to facilitate the implementation of the scenarios they design. With this in mind, our work takes a two-pronged approach: first, the analysis and modelling of a LRPG scenario design process based on the re-use of models and, second, the specification of a design-support environment (ScenLRPG) based on the model devised. The paper then focuses on a key stage of our work: the identification of game principles that may be used in a LRPG scenario. Six game principles have been identified from the study of literature on games and motivation. The article describes how these game principles are specialized to cater with our specific subject that is LRPG scenarios for professional training. Our categorisation of these principles and characteristics about how they can be implemented in a LRPG scenario are detailed. As an illustration, the game principles selected are used to describe an example of LRPG scenario. To conclude, the paper discusses the future outlook for the use of these elements in the design process and the support environment.","2010","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","462-469","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000307871500055","","","","_plot structure; _roleplayification; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _GAMEPLAY","","Meyer, B.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the simplest form, a small number of identical dice are rolled and added, but more advanced forms involve cumulative re-rolling of 6's, doubling the value of doubles, removing the lowest or highest result or counting the number of dice that are below a threshold, and many other weird and wonderful modifications. While die-roll programs and net-based die-roll servers exist, they can usually only handle the simplest form of die-rolls. This paper describes Roll, a simple functional language for defining how dice are rolled. Such definitions are then used to emulate die-rolls or make probability calculations. We describe two different semantics for Roll: One that corresponds to randomly rolling the dice and one for calculating the probability distribution. We discuss implementation issues regarding the latter.","2003","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","145-159","","","","","","Roll","","LNCS 2562","","","Springer-Verlag Berlin","Berlin","en","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000181653900011","","","","_dice; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM-lu","","Dahl, Veronica; Wadler, Philip","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The characteristics of players of FRPGs were compared to non-players through the administration of measures of psychopathology (TSC-40, RSE), dissociation (DES), IQ (Shipley's Institute of Living Scale), imagery ability (Absorption, Betts Imagery Vividness, PPI (XT)), fantasy proneness (ICMI), and hypnotizability (CURSS:O). FRPG subjects (n = 45) and control subjects (n = 45) were found to be indistinguishable by scores on psychopathology measures. FRPG players were found, however, to have elevated IQ, Absorption, Fantasy Proneness, and Temporal Lobe Lability scores. While hypnotic susceptibility was not found to differentiate the groups, Absorption, Frequency of FRPG play, and Number of FRPG systems experienced, were found to significantly predict hypnotic susceptibility within the FRPG group. The presence of the gaming variables as significant predictors shows variance in susceptibility not explained through imagery ability, nor other established predictors in the literature. Factor analysis suggests that involvement in FRPGs is less a correlate of imagery ability than it is of a tendency towards fantasy.","1995","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","126","","","","","Fantasy role players","","","","","Carleton University","Ottawa, ON","en","Copyright UMI - Dissertations Publishing 1995","M.A. in Psychology","","","Web of Science","","Number: 2A WOS:A1995QZ31000298  bibtex: barnett_fantasy_1995","","","","_hypnosis; _canada; _TTRPG; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents the results of an empirical study, examining how multi-player tabletop RPGs are affected as they are ported to the digital medium. Issues examined include the use of disposition assessments to predict play experience, the effect of group dynamics, the influence of the fictional game characters and the comparative play experience between the two formats. The results indicate that group dynamics and the relationship between the players and their digital characters, are integral to the quality of the gaming experience in multiplayer RPGs, with the first being of greater importance to digital games and the latter to the tabletop version.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 17:03:21","2015-07-30 16:48:00","1-29","","","5","","","Group play","","","","","","","en","","","","","CrossRef","","Number: 4 QID: Q107169173","","","","_peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parallels exist between composition pedagogy and the techniques ""players"" and the leader in a Dungeons and Dragons-like game utilize to tell a story: collaboration, understanding audience, and maintaining continuity and coherence. Teachers in a composition classroom and Game Masters in a tabletop, pen and paper roleplaying game use similar techniques to achieve similar goals.

Most popularly, focus on performativity has been the discursive construction of gendered identity/identities. Though a number of studies have sought to examine the role language performance plays in construction, a surprising few have aimed to look at activities focused on the intentional creation and maintenance of identities in a specifically performative context such as: improvisational acting and roleplaying games. This study uses a social constructionist framework through discourse analysis to examine a community of practice centered around the performance of multiple roles during a 9 hour session of Dungeons and Dragons, a tabletop roleplaying game, in order to see what strategies players employed to call out specific gendered roles and what those strategies might assume about identity construction. Primarily, how does language choice illustrate the theory that identity is not only co-constructed, but that each person embodies a series of sometimes conflicting gender identities that are often contested? The results of the research show evidence that each person constructs for themselves and others not one, but multiple, identities in the course of conversation and often for different purposes.","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-06-25 19:55:22","","96","","","","","","","","","","Southern Illinois University at Carbondale","Carbondale, IL","en","Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2012","MA Applied Linguistics","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_language learning; _literature; _identity; _theater; _dnd; _gender; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008. Gygax's magnum opus, Dungeons & Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and '80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni--Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered. Gygax's involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&D's parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating. But as Witwer shows, perhaps the most compelling facet of his life and work was his unwavering commitment to the power of creativity in the face of myriad sources of adversity, whether cultural, economic, or personal. Through his creation of the role-playing genre, Gygax gave two generations of gamers the tools to invent characters and entire worlds in their minds. Told in narrative-driven and dramatic fashion, Witwer has written an engaging chronicle of the life and legacy of this emperor of the imagination.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","320","","","","","Empire of Imagination","","","","","Bloomsbury Press","New York, NY","en","","","","","Amazon","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QTZ25IGA","thesis","2013","Iler, Dustin R.","Narrative at Risk: Accident and Teleology in American Culture, 1963--2013","","","","","http://search.proquest.com/pqdtglobal/docview/1442809470/8AE0AF1E4AA04AB2PQ/36?accountid=12543","Accident in fiction is always inevitable. When a character in a novel suffers a car accident, for example, the accident is the effect of the author's intentions, and therefore it is not accidental. The accidents in the narrative always happen the same way, reading after rereading. Drawing from this observation, the question that Narrative at Risk attempts to answer is, in its simplest iteration: how can narrative accurately represent accident when its textual representation is not subject to the effects of accident? I ask this of a number of American cultural objects that were produced over the last fifty years, from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy to the present. Narrative at Risk interrogates representations of accident primarily in novels and films--but also in television, roleplaying games, comic strips, and videogames--in order to examine how contemporary American culture ascribes meaning to the accidental. I read a wide array of accidents--from mechanical failures to failed suicides, depictions of biological evolution to games of chance--as providing a broad but coherent understanding of how American society has conceived of accident in relation to individuals, communities, and the species as a whole. Narrative at Risk , in treating media such as film, television, and videogames alongside literature, broadens our understanding of how accident developed as a danger over the past fifty years, as well as how various media influenced and shaped one another through borrowed reading practices. In the introduction, I focus on the crystallization of the mass media that brought traumatic events into American homes again and again, specifically, the moment of President John F. Kennedy's assassination and the epistemological and ontological crises this event and its media coverage initiated. The first chapter reads the role of this mediation and the crises of the 1960s as they jointly inform representations of accidental mechanical failure. Through readings of four texts, I theorize a politics of accident, taking as my initial subject what Ronald Reagan called his most formative moment: his role as a train accident victim in King's Row (1941), and his discussion of this role in his 1965 memoir Where's the Rest of Me ? I delineate how Reagan's obsession with narrating accident later shaped a politics of the accident in texts such as David Cronenberg's film Crash (1996), Don DeLillo's novel White Noise (1985), Colson Whitehead's novel The Intuitionist (1999), and Rockstar Game's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004). The subsequent chapter shifts from the first's broad historical range to texts composed and published at the end of the Cold War: Paul Auster's novel Leviathan (1992); Jeffrey Eugenides's novel The Virgin Suicides (1993); and ""Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man"" (1996) an episode of the television show The X-Files (1993-2002). I read the failure of suicide attempts in these texts as accidents that express the limits of intentionality, which bring to the fore the nation's inability to conceive of a future beyond the ideological bounds of the conflict with the Soviet Union that provided meaning during the Cold War. The third chapter recontextualizes the final years of the Cold War. Here I read Richard Kenney's poem, ""A Colloquy of Ancient Men"" from his collection, The Invention of the Zero (1993), alongside two novels: Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park (1990) and Richard Powers's The Gold Bug Variations (1991). Rather than depicting the futurelessness of the United States, these texts look to deep history on the scale of evolutionary time. They depict evolution as a series of random, accidental changes that take place in the history of a species' development; in doing so, they together trace the Cold War fear of thermonuclear annihilation shifting to an anxiety of genetic manipulation. The fourth chapter turns to the 1970s to investigate the early years of the culture wars. I begin by reading how chance disrupts the narrative of Kathy Acker's novel Blood and Guts in High School (1984), then consider the religious right's hyperbolic condemnation of chance in TSR's roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons (1974). I then scrutinize games of chance in three other texts: Michael Cimino's film The Deer Hunter (1978); Thomas Pynchon's novel Gravity's Rainbow (1973); and Sam Lipsyte's short story ""The Dungeon Master"" (2010). These three cases demonstrate how chance undermines the paranoid fantasy that there are external forces authoring the world. Finally, Narrative at Risk concludes with an exploration of accident in the present through a discussion of two television shows--Breaking Bad (2008-2013) and The Americans (2013- )--and Steve Erickson's 2012 novel These Dreams of You . Imagining accidents as the fault of the government, these texts collectively suggest American culture's continued reliance upon teleological thinking and conspiracy theory.

Based on nineteen months of participant-observation of a gaming group, twenty in-depth interviews, and archival data from email lists and websites, I show gamers used gaming to construct a moral identity, court self-testing risks, and explore possible selves. Gamers created the moral identity ""good gamer"" through display of six qualities: dedication, cooperation, selflessness, creativity, intelligence, and authenticity. By displaying these qualities, gamers constructed themselves not only as good gamers, but as good people. Gamers courted self-testing risks by engaging in ""edgework without the edge."" This involved gamers testing the limits of fantasy characters' abilities and putting those characters' lives, rather than their own, at risk. Gamers also engaged in fictive heroism, creating characters who were slightly better versions of themselves. By putting these characters through adventures and ordeals in a fictional game world, gamers explored alternative moralities and possible selves. My research shows how activities that are largely based on imagination and might be seen by many as frivolous can have serious real-world consequences. Future research might thus fruitfully examine how other activities that occur in virtual or imaginary worlds come to shape real-world identities and self-conceptions.","2013","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2015-06-29 15:07:40","","180","","","","","","","","","","North Carolina State University","Raleigh, NC","en","Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2013","Ph.D. in Sociology","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_identity; _TTRPG; _sex-transgressive; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","Edgework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Players engage with religion and religious concepts in TRPGs through mechanics and system rules, setting, and interpersonal interactions with other gamers during the game session. Together these three facets of the TRPG experience create a bridge between the player and the game environment. This allows for players to experience the game setting as part of their conventional reality. Religious constructs erected in the game world and interacted with via the player's character, become authentic expressions of religion worthy of study by scholars of religion. Religion becomes actualized by the player as he translates the experience of his character into personal experience with the game environment. Mechanics help facilitate that translation by creating the liminal space of the game. Rules and system create boundaries for the game that creates the place where religious play can occur. setting then fills the liminal space providing the environment that is explored, creating an understandable engagement with religious components of the game. Lastly, the act of play, by the player, creates religious belief within the setting. Taken together the game experience of the TRPG is actuated to conventional religious experience, which opens it up as a subject for religious study.","2012-03","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","133","","","","","","","","","","Concordia University","Montréal, QC","en","","MA History and Philosophy of Religion","","","","","","","","","_canada; _religion; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before the invention of D&D, both acting/narrative-based games and strategy-based war games that made use of fantasy-genre elements existed, but the way D&D integrates both elements invented a whole new category of game, one in which the immersive draw of a plot proves just as important as good tactics or luck of the dice. This chapter explores the relationship between the qualitative and quantitative aspects of D&D. Specifically, it argues that the rules of the game provide quantitative corollaries to aspects of storytelling that we traditionally think of as qualitative: character, morality, personal development, etc. These quantitative components, however, serve a far greater function than merely providing a measurable foundation on which to base dice rolls: More than the fantastic creatures and the magic spells in the game, quantification is perhaps the D&D's greatest fantasy. Through such quantification, the game is able to provide its players with an unshakeable moral order, a numerical measure of normally intangible personal attributes (such as intelligence), and a running total of a character's growth and success as a ""person."" The purpose of all of this accountancy is to satisfy the very deep desire for a world of known quantities and calculable success, which in turn allows for a sense of achievement that is difficult to match in a complex, qualitative world. With such foci, the author of this chapter raises questions about the influence of Dungeons and Dragons on its successors while also providing insight into its continued popularity. With online games' (Asheron's Call, EverQuest) obvious debt to Dungeons and Dragons, such a study is especially timely.","2006","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:02:27","2015-07-16 16:22:37","","","1","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 1","","","","_dnd; _mechanics; series:gygax-actuarial-quantified-self; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Une question renouvelée","Dossier d’actualité de la Veille scientifique et technologique (Institut national de recherche pédagogique)","","","","http://www.ffjdr.org/wp-content/uploads/Jeu_et_apprentissage.pdf","Jouer à l’école, est-ce bien raisonnable ? Bien souvent, le jeu se fait rare après l’école maternelle, pour ne surgir à nouveau que le dernier jour avant la sortie des classes... comme si ce n’était déjà plus l’école et que l’on pouvait donc s’amuser un peu. Et pourtant... De nombreux travaux de recherche éclairent la place spécifique et le rôle original du jeu dans le processus d’apprentissage. Des enseignants utilisent des jeux de plateaux ou des jeux de rôle, et sont sollicités pour recourir au jeu vidéo en classe : la pratique du jeu dans le cadre extrascolaire a contribué dans le même temps à poser à nouveau la question de l’utilisation au service de l’acquisition de connaissances et de compétences. La définition, la place et le rôle du jeu à l’école ont une histoire longue et contrastée. Des initiatives variées, individuelles ou institutionnelles, ont été prises dans différents systèmes éducatifs : « jouer » à l’école est possible. Les enseignants qui intègrent le jeu sous une forme ou une autre ne sont pas forcément joueurs eux-mêmes : c’est l’impact positif du jeu sur la motivation et sur les apprentissages qui les a générale- ment convaincus de tenter l’expérience. Jeux dramatiques et jeux de rôle favorisent en effet la motivation des élèves, servent de levier aux apprentissages et sont des outils précieux dans une approche de l’enseignement orientée vers le développement de compétences. La connaissance des processus cognitifs plaide pour l’utilisation de jeux en classe, re- posant ou non sur un support informatique. Loin de pouvoir se passer de l’enseignant, le jeu éducatif exige de ce dernier qu’il « joue son rôle », rôle en partie redéfini par la configuration du jeu. Qu’il participe ou non à sa conception, l’enseignant conserve une place déterminante car, dans une visée pédagogique en relation avec le curriculum, le jeu n’est pas une fin en soi. Il doit y avoir un avant-jeu et un après-jeu pour favoriser l’analyse réflexive et les « compétences méta ». Ce dossier propose d’explorer ce renouveau dans les relations entre jeu et école, à travers une revue de la littérature scientifique récente, en France et à l’étranger.","2009-10","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2015-07-16 17:58:35","15","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Number: 48","","","","_curriculum; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =french; _yo1-12; _OTHER GAMES; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"6N4PYTT7","thesis","2007","David, Coralie","Le jeu de rôle, mode d’expression littéraire ?","","","","","http://www.ffjdr.org/wp-content/uploads/jdr-fond-etude_cdavid-etude_cdavid.pdf","Le terme jeu de rôle est souvent mal interprété et méconnu. En effet, il est confondu avec toute sorte d'activités qui ne le concerne que peu, comme les jeux de rôles en entreprise, les thérapies psychologiques, etc. Ici, nous allons étudier le jeu de rôle sous sa forme première, en tant qu'activité créative dont beaucoup de caractéristiques peuvent se rapporter à des domaines littéraires, comme la narratologie. Pourtant, il n'existe en France que peu d'études littéraires sur le sujet, c'est pourquoi nous avons décidé d'y consacrer ce mémoire.   Nous avons porté notre choix de corpus sur trois œuvres:     - INS / MV: ce jeu français met en scène des anges et des démons qui vivent dans notre monde réel et contemporain. Ils se livrent une guerre ancestrale et secrète pour obtenir l'âme des êtres humains qui ne se doutent de rien. On peut jouer des anges ou des démons.    - Shadowrun: ce jeu américain prend place dans un univers cyberpunk, dans une réalité alternative dystopique. La magie est apparue après les années 2000, introduisant des éléments d'heroic fantasy. Le monde est contrôlé par des multinationales tentaculaires qui rivalisent pour acquérir de plus en plus de pouvoir. On y joue des mercenaires à la solde de ces ""méga-corporations"".     - Vampire: le Requiem: l'univers décrit par ce jeu américain est le même que le nôtre, à ceci près que certaines créatures surnaturelles (loups-garous, fantômes) existent et évoluent dans l'ombre. Ici on joue des vampires, êtres nocturnes torturées par leur condition.   Nous allons donc nous consacrer à la découverte du jeu de rôle en passant essentiellement par des exemples tirés de ce corpus, sachant que nous aurons également recours à d'autres jeux plus épisodiquement. Il s'agit bien ici d'une découverte, puisque peu de gens sont capables de définir le jeu de rôle selon des critères littéraires. Nous nous attacherons alors à répondre à la question suivante: en quoi le jeu de rôle est une nouvelle forme littéraire qui créé et régit ses propres caractéristiques et codes ?  D'abord, nous allons essayer de définir le jeu de rôle et de présenter les différentes écoles de pensées qui l'ont théorisé afin d'arriver à notre propre définition. Ensuite, nous tenterons de démontrer que les univers rôlistiques sont proches des mondes paralittéraires, genre auquel appartient sûrement le jeu de rôle. Enfin, nous étudierons les différentes techniques littéraires employées dans les jeux de rôles et les buts qu'elles s'efforcent d'atteindre.","2007","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-28 17:59:29","2015-07-16 18:09:53","","136","","","","","","","","","","Université de Toulouse Le Mirail","Toulouse","fr","","MA Littérature comparée","","","","","","","","","_literature; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =french; =SD; _PSYCHOLOGY; _wod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work had as objective determine what is the conception that the systematic players possess regarding the games of characters’ interpretation, or Role-Playing Games, as well as the motivational factors that lead to the practice of this game. It was used for the collection of the data a partner-demographic questionnaire and a semi-open interview; the last one was analyzed based on certain categories that started from the themes that were raised. The categories demonstrated that RPG is viewed as an improvised theater, a leisure activity, a therapy, a personality projection, a facilitator of personal relationships and as an opportunity to meet friends. It was certain that the players’ main motivation was friendship, the will of being with the game companions. The game of RPG possesses positive characteristics as much as negatives, and the difference would be in the way it is used. The result of the research makes way for future studies on that kind of game that is already inserted in the mass culture.","2009","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-21 01:50:22","2015-07-21 17:08:17","700-717","","4","29","","","The Conception of the Role-Playing Game (RPG) in Systematic Player","","","","","","","pt","","","","0","CrossRef","","Number: 4 QID: Q114785014","","","https://doi.org/10.1590/s1414-98932009000400005","_therapy; _motivation; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _belonging; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; =PM-lu; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Starting with a gentle introduction to old school tabletop RPGs by way of their history and a rundown of the most popular titles, the authors walk librarians through the complete process of adding these games to their collection, discussing the qualities one should look for when considering what games to select, the technical aspects of cataloging them, and cementing RPGs as a bona fide resource rather than a bait-and-switch diversion. Torres-Roman and Snow aren't afraid to give real, practical advice about dealing with problem patrons and the potentially emotionally charged environment of gaming. Appendices include a guide to current games, with an easy-to-understand ratings system that allows review of the game's key parameters at a glance, and a list of games tagged by genre. VERDICT Librarians who have been successfully integrating role-playing games into their programs for some time won't find much new here, but those who are just experimenting with the medium will see that as an invaluable guide, and even those seasoned pros could use it as a handy desk reference.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","212","","","","","Dragons in the stacks","Libraries Unlimited Professional Guides for Young Adult Librarians Series","","","","Libraries Unlimited","Santa Barbara, CA","en","","","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _LEARNING; _LIBRARY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lovecraft's short-story “The Call of Cthulhu”, published in 1928 in an issue of Weird Tales, was paramount for the evolution of what is known today as Science Fiction. By means of applying Gothic fiction tropes in his narratives, together with cosmic entities from outer space, Lovecraft is undoubtedly a pioneer in the xenofiction genre. Despite his unsuccessful career as a writer, both setting and lore surrounding Lovecratf's oeuvre eventually became popular in the late twentieth century, originating other works of fiction, as well as games, following the same style. The concept of role-playing game has its roots in the 1930s popular parlor game Jury Box. However, it was only in 1974, after Dungeons & Dragons was published, that the concept became widespread. Like any other games, from the simplest to the most complex, role-playing games have rules that define the conditions of victory or defeat. However, there are certain peculiarities which make role-playing games different from conventional video games. These aspects are in fact elements which are intrinsically related to theatrics and dramatic expression, namely the narrator and the actor. This paper will examine the relationship between the concept of game and theatrics as well as the role of performative acts in this relationship. As such, Call of Cthulhu (1981), a tabletop role-playing game based on lovecraftian fictional lore and myths, will be used to counter Roger Caillois's statement in Man, Play and Games (1961) that 'A characteristic of play, in fact, is that it creates no wealth or goods, thus differing from work or art.' (Caillois 2001: 5). In order to do this, it will be demonstrated that, despite being a game, tabletop role-playing games in general, with particular emphasis on Call of Cthulhu, actually do create something of literary value.","2014-11-19","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:30:15","2015-09-18 19:55:33","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","Université de Lisbonne","Lisbonne","","","","","","","","","","","","_dnd; _lovecraft; _oral communication; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Science Fiction and Fantasy International Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emphasis is on the playing of the roles, as it were, and less so on the game mechanics. Curiously, the phrase ‘RPG elements’ tends not to refer to the role-playing aspects of the genre, but to the rules, systems, and mechanisms that have been co-opted by other game genres and ‘gamification’ practitioners. In this article we unpack the term ‘RPG elements’ by examining a single element: mechanisms and systems for character progression in paper and pencil RPGs. In these open ended games, playercontrolled characters’ capabilities change. Characters usually get better; though sometimes they get worse. We describe different ways positive and negative character progression systems are implemented and the role they play. We also discuss some differences we observe between paper and pencil RPGs and those played electronically. We conclude with thoughts on the utility of breaking down ambiguous terms, such as ‘RPG elements’ into smaller, clearer units.","2014","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-23 17:46:17","2015-09-18 20:02:39","","","","","","","Examining ‘RPG Elements’","","","","","","Ft.

The past forty years have seen participants drawn to the game by notions of “fun” or “enjoyment”, however as some sociologists argue, there are elements of tautology to this reasoning. While this critique may offer verity, qualitative research would suggest participant rationale is at least superficially valid, yet evokes a call to further understanding. This paper offers a preliminary analysis of the underlying motivations for playing D&D examining concepts such as engrossment, identification, play, freedom, self-expression and various adverse affects associated with the game. Theoretically positioning Gary Alan Fine’s Shared Fantasy: Role- Playing Games as Social Worlds (1983) as the primary textual framework  underpinning this research, and juxtaposing this with a participant Internet survey (2014), this paper seeks to explore these factors, while acknowledging and maintaining the oft repeated maxim that the game is “fun”.","2015-06","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-04 16:27:16","2015-09-21 18:11:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","_bleed; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many role-playing games, such as Dungeons & Dragons, use a formalised notation for some instances of dice-rolls. This notation, once explained, make dice-roll descriptions concise and unambiguous. Furthermore, the notation has been used in automated tools for pseudo-random dice-rolling (typically used when playing over the Internet). This notation is, however, fairly limited in the types of dice-rolls it can describe, so most games still use natural language to describe rolls. Even Dungeons & Dragons use formal notation only for some of the dice-roll methods used in the game. Hence, a more complete notation is in this paper proposed, and a tool for pseudo-random rolls and (nearly) exact probability calculations is described. The notation is called ""Troll"", combining the initial of the Danish word for dice (""terninger"") with the English word ""roll"". It is a development of the language Roll described in an earlier paper. The present paper describes the most important features of Troll and its implementation.","2009","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:31:26","2015-11-13 16:04:41","1910–1915","","","","","","","SAC '09","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","_language learning; _dnd; _dice; _probability; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM-lu; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, geek culture is becoming increasingly mainstream; for example, in the past year alone, Dragon*Con, a major Geek convention in Atlanta, Georgia, attracted an attendance of over 57,000 members. The present article uses an individual differences approach to examine three theoretical accounts of geek culture. Seven studies (N = 2354) develop the Geek Culture Engagement Scale (GCES) to quantify geek engagement and assess its relationships to theoretically relevant personality and individual differences variables. These studies present evidence that individuals may engage in geek culture in order to maintain narcissistic self-views (the great fantasy migration hypothesis), to fulfill belongingness needs (the belongingness hypothesis), and to satisfy needs for creative expression (the need for engagement hypothesis). Geek engagement is found to be associated with elevated grandiose narcissism, extraversion, openness to experience, depression, and subjective well-being across multiple samples. These data lay the groundwork for further exploration of geek culture as well as provide a foundation for examining other forms of subculture participation.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:20:10","2016-05-05 18:52:52","","","11","10","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2015 McCain et al.

"SJGN3EAN","thesis","2015","Trammell, Aaron","The ludic imagination: a history of role-playing games, politics, and simulation in Cold War America, 1954-1984","","","","","http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.7282/T3PR7XZ8","How have the ways we imagine and understand games changed since World War II? Play and games, although inextricably connected, have come to mean quite different things in the early twenty-first century popular culture, and I argue that this change is a cultural product of The Cold War. Today, games are described as products, systems, and even rituals. It is assumed that all games have rules, and these rules are shared through code, manuals, and sometimes oral tradition. Whereas games are systems, play is the embodied phenomenon associated with navigating such systems. Play relates specifically to bodies, and is often—though not necessarily always—connected to games. The nature of games and play is generally agreed upon in both popular discourse and by game studies scholarship. People play games, people play with each other, and the essence of play cannot be reduced to any one product, container, system of rules, or even social ritual. Rules may contort the dynamics of play, but they cannot define the essence of the phenomenon. Building on these distinctions, this dissertation claims, first, that our definitions of games and play are discursively contingent. Second, it develops this point by showing how in the latter half of the twentieth century, games began to be explicitly valorized over play. Games are typically seen as valuable, productive, and potentially transformative, while play is normally associated with leisurely, childish, and chaotic behavior. Third, alongside the valorization of games over play there has emerged a discourse that this dissertation terms the ludic imagination in which “truth” is conflated with quantitative and competitive logics. The ludic imagination contributes to other studies of the Cold War by focusing on the value placed on rationality as well as the affects of isolation and fear that characterize the era’s popular culture and military policy. I use correspondence, internal reports and memos from the RAND Corporation Archive and The MIT Center for International Studies, as well as hobby publications and trade publications from The Ray Browne Popular Culture Archive and the Dragon Magazine CD-ROM Archive in order to reveal a historical arc that connects military ideology around games and play to popular culture. This arc includes documentation from the RAND Corporation, correspondence within a grassroots network of gamers that included play-by-mail Diplomacy hobbyists, and the design notes of Dungeons & Dragons players. Through these primary sources, I show how networks of military elites at the RAND Corporation overlapped with networks of grassroots hobbyists and together imagined the intersection of games and play. This reading evaluates the limits of these terms by considering how racism, sexism, and homophobia collude with the quantitative and essentialist worldview of military logistics.

Participants have been drawn to D&D for over forty years, departing into imagined and collaborative fantasy worlds. This thesis is concerned with analysing current participatory practices in D&D, accounting for evolving styles of hybridised gaming and retentions of traditional tabletop play. It ventures beyond initial conceptual enquiries, developing tangible conclusions to the questions: “How important is the idea of community when playing Dungeons & Dragons ?” and “What is appealing about constructing fictitious identities within the group, actualised through notions of play? ” To assist in answering these questions an Internet survey was developed. Survey data is presented, analysed, and contrasted with existing role­playing game scholarship. Emergent findings discuss participant experiences of “entertainment” “fantasy”, “community”, and preferred “ D&D editions ”. It is strongly contended that D&D transcends the superficialities associated with a “game”. Participants powerfully engage — transmuting participatory experiences into broader realms of purpose and meaning. The game facilitates the continual formation and negotiation of community and identity, demonstrating its wider socio­cultural applicability. The ability and appeal to engage with substantial identity exploration is clearly observable within D&D practices. The game offers participants accessibility into divergent paradigms of reality. Participants’ playful explorations have a lasting effect in the “real world”. Finally, participants develop and enjoy a strong sense of community through their long-term gaming relationships. Regardless of whether these communities are enacted in “online” or “offline” spheres, these spaces endow participants with substantial benefits — belonging, acceptance, and a shared sense of “fun”.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:52:11","2016-02-03 15:32:02","","134","","","","","","","","","","Auckland University of Technology","Auckland","en","","MA.

Para alcançar tal objetivo foram realizadas pesquisas teóricas sobre design de jogos, educação e RPG - Role Playing Game. Esta pesquisa também apresenta um resumo da compilação teórica sobre emoções e entretenimento, originalmente realizada pelo pesquisador finlandês, da área de design de games, Aki Järvinen. Para a realização desta adaptação foi feita uma extensa análise do jogo comercial Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, em busca de conhecimento sobre sua construção, seguido da análise de um método tradicional de ensino de inglês e a estrutura física da sala de aula. Uma vez concluída a adaptação do jogo, um questionário foi desenvolvido para medir qualitativamente o entretenimento e as emoções dos jogadores sentidas durante uma aula utilizando o jogo adaptado, sob a luz da teoria da experiência do jogador desenvolvida por Aki Järvinen. Finalmente, após um experimento aplicado em sala de aula com um grupo de alunos iniciando o curso de língua inglesa, os dados qualitativos coletados com o questionário foram analisados. O resultado indicou que os alunos se sentiram mais entretidos e mais motivados durante a aula de inglês, utilizando o método com o jogo adaptado, do que a aula utilizando o método tradicional de ensino de inglês.","2011","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:11:58","2016-02-03 15:44:49","","188","","","","","","","","","","Universidade Federal do Paraná","Curitiba","pt","","MA Design","","","dspace.c3sl.ufpr.br:8080","","","","","","_language learning; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A hypothesis was developed that higher levels of empathy would be found in individuals who fantasy role-play based upon previous research in hypnosis such as J. R. Hilgard’s (1970) imaginative involvement hypothesis, research into the “fantasy prone” personality type (Wilson & Barber, 1981), and the empathic involvement hypothesis (Wickramasekera II & Szlyk, 2003). The participants in the current study were 127 fantasy role-players who volunteered and completed the Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (empathy) and the Tellegen Absorption Scale (absorption). The results demonstrated that those who play fantasy role-playing games scored significantly higher than the comparison group on the IRI scale of empathy, confirming the hypothesis that fantasy role-players report experiencing higher levels of empathic involvement with others. Correlational analysis between the measures demonstrated a significant positive correlation between empathy and absorption (r = .43, p < .001). These results collectively suggest that fantasy role-players have a uniquely empathically-imaginative style. The results also confirm and extend previous findings on the relationship between empathy and absorption as predicted by the Empathic Involvement Hypothesis (Wickramasekera II & Szlyk, 2003).","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:21:52","2016-02-16 21:17:19","286-294","","3","58","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","0","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Number: 3 PMID: 26675155  bibtex: rivers_empathic_2016 QID: Q50549990","","","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26675155","_immersion; _major publication; _therapy; _empathy; _hypnosis; sourceRPGresearch; _anxiety; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =blogged; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =PM; =citation-alert:WOS; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1980s, there was a major campaign attacking RPGs. Because of the inaction of the game publishers' organization at that time, CAR-PGa was formed to find out what the problem was. CAR-PGa members' research showed that the charges—the same ones that are repeated to this day—had absolutely no foundation in fact. Today, CAR-PGa's primary focus has shifted from game defense to a study of all aspects of RPGs: Material is collected by members and sent to the Chair, who catalogs it and publishes a notice of the new acquisitions in the Newsletter along with other game information. When an attack on RPGs resurfaces, CAR-PGa makes sure that its members know about it and they check the relevant research and records of historical attacks, investigate the specific circumstances of the renewed attack, and respond with the hard facts. Membership is dues-free, but work is expected from our members. This can include a number of things: writing a letter to the editor of the local newspaper or writing a peer-reviewed paper for a scholarly publication; keeping a watch on the mass media for any story that may affect gamers; collecting material from anti-gamer organizations; an appearance on local TV or radio; finding us a grant; recruiting more active members; etc. Beyond that, we only ask that members keep us informed of these things, sending us copies of material produced or found so we can make it available to the rest of the group, and keep us informed of any changes in the membership-form data.","1988","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 20:13:50","2016-02-17 19:46:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","_moral panic; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 21st century Lovecraft storyworld is elicited by textual fiction, interactive fiction, short and feature-length films, fan art, comics, music, board games, role-playing games, computer games and interactive environments online, to name just a few examples. This transmedial foundation, which continues to grow, prompts several questions. What allure does the storyworld hold for both audiences and producers? How do works engage with its core elements in familiar yet media-specific ways? How has this developing storyworld contributed to 'pulp' writer Lovecraft’s apparent elevation into the American literary canon? In this essay I explore the poetics of the Lovecraft storyworld’s development, its transmedial adaptability and its cultural significance for both contemporary audiences and Lovecraft's legacy.","2014","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:51:34","2016-02-05 15:30:40","332-350","","","","","","","","","","","University of Nebraska Press","Lincoln, NE","en","","","","","www.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_literature; _lovecraft; _genre; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Ryan, Marie-Laure; Thon, Jan-Noël","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BDM9KBNU","thesis","2008","DeHart, Gretchen L.","Out of character : issues of identity, acceptance,and creativity in tabletop role-playing games","","","","","http://cardinalscholar.bsu.edu/handle/123456789/193592","A thesis presented on modern tabletop role-playing games and how they offer anthropologists a new way to approach issues of creativity, identity construction, social interaction, and the nature of play in American culture. In these games, players continuously challenge and redefine aspects of personal identity, social paradigms, gender identity, and reality construction. This thesis is exemplified by the interactions of two separate role-playing groups in Muncie, Indiana, as well as multiple interviews with gamers from many different areas. This idea is also clearly reflected in the interactions of role-players, both in their own personas and in character. Multiple layers of roles, in both the fictional world and within the social group of the players, are created, accepted, adapted, and discarded during the course of an average game.  Gamers’ voices are emphasized, rather than game play itself, in order to explore how gamers feel and think about their play. Both Ludology and Carnival are explored as possible ways to approach the subject. Play in general allows individuals and/or small groups the creative space to form new strategies to enact personal and cultural change in the reality outside of the game; while tabletop RPGs allow players the liminal space to explore different aspects of their personal identities, even as they create an outlet for challenging social strictures. Negative cultural labeling of these games as deviant and subversive has created the illusion of secrecy that helps the games to function in this manor. The importance of both play and narrative become obvious when speaking to gamers about their hobby; allowing the gamers to form a sub-culture based on the shared experiences of the games. And it is in these shared experiences that the gamers find the power to alter their real-life self images, and experiment with change.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:52:11","2016-02-17 20:36:32","","118","","","","","Out of character","","","","","Ball State University","Muncie, IN","en","","MA Anthropology","","","cardinalscholar.bsu.edu","","","","","","_creativity; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Creating Role-Playing Games Based on Traditional Stories for the High School Curriculum","","","","","https://dc.etsu.edu/etd/1469","The goal of this thesis is to develop a template for turning traditional stories into role-playing games for the high school curriculum. By developing 3 sample games based on Greek mythology, Arthurian legends, and a widespread folktale type, I explored the process of creating games that fit the limits of secondary classrooms and can be used to address specific educational standards. The sample games were tested with groups of high school and college students, and the results of the testing sessions evaluated in a narrative case study format. Feedback from the testing sessions was incorporated in the template, the final product of the thesis project. By exploring tabletop role-playing as a form of emergent interactive storytelling, a connection has been created between traditional storytelling and popular culture with the hope of reaching out to new audiences and introducing a stronger interactive element into storytelling in secondary education.","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-28 15:09:37","","","223","","","","","","","","","","East Tennessee State University","Johnson City, TN","en","","MA in Reading","","","","","","","","","_storytelling; _reading; _curriculum; _yo13-19; sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reflecting on his experiences teaching college-level fiction writing built around role-playing games (RPGs), the author explains how a combination of RPG rules and aleatory elements provide both structure and spontaneity for beginning fiction writers, but also pose significant classroom challenges. He argues that instructors can use the combination of quantitative and qualitative information found in RPG catalogs as models for the collaborative creation of fictional worlds through the processes of critical world building and detailed character creation exercises.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:36:03","2015-12-15 14:10:54","","","","","","","","","","","","Academia.edu","","","","","","","","","","","","","_worldbuilding; _writing; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _character; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Students studied the narrative unit operations (Bogost 2006) present in short fiction, films, and the videogame Fallout 3  before collaboratively creating an immersive fictional world by populating a wiki with items, locations, and characters. Students explored their newly created world through tabletop role-playing campaigns and wrote vignette-length stories from their characters’ perspectives. Students strongly preferred this approach to the traditional workshop method commonly used in creative writing classes, citing stronger understanding of character and motivations as well as the significant benefits derived from collaborative writing. Role-playing also fostered a strong and supportive community for student writers. Despite institutional challenges, role-playing games offer a compelling way to improve current fiction writing pedagogical practices and encourage new modes of collaborative writing.","2011","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:24:35","2015-12-15 14:12:51","103–108","","","","","","Gaming, world building, and narrative","","","","","ETC Press","Pittsburgh, PA","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_worldbuilding; _writing; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, writes Gravois, academic medievalists have viewed this engorged popular interest not as an embarrassment of riches, but as simply embarrassment. Yet those same re-enactors, role players, and fantasy buffs make some of the most natural candidates for academic study of the Middle Ages. Surely, thought Gravois, the two worlds must be mixing, as generations of gamers and fantasy buffs have matured into scholars. Gravois shares his thought from the International Congress on Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University, the world's premier annual gathering of scholars who study the middle ages, where one attendant asked ""When you say 'fantasy,'"" she said, ""you think 'medieval.' So: Why?"" The simplest answer to that question, says Gravois, is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien. Dungeons & Dragons, World of Warcraft, EverQuest: all of them derive from Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, a world built from medieval languages, references, and literary conventions. Some scholars say Renaissance Faires and the Society for Creative Anachronism got their momentum from Tolkien's surge in popularity in the 1960s. At the same time, Tolkien is an immensely important figure in medieval studies. Modern medievalists credit him with being the first scholar to treat Beowulf and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as texts with literary depth, instead of just as linguistic time capsules. It is thanks to him, many believe, that those poems have become canonical works rather than obscurities. Daniel T. Kline, a professor of medieval and Renaissance English at the University of Alaska at Anchorage offers another insight that far predates Tolkien. Kline, along with other scholars of the middle ages, has begun thinking about fantasy literature and role-playing games as actual revivals of medieval literary forms. Arthurian legends, he and others say, had a similar open-ended narrative structure, a similar relationship to an ahistorical imagined past and a similar kind of open authorship. Unlike more modern forms, the medieval approach to storytelling is one that lends itself perfectly to fantasy worlds that can be endlessly constructed, reconstructed, and traversed.","2007","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2016-03-23 20:13:41","A8","","44","53","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ProQuest","","Number: 44","","","","_dnd; _neomedievalism; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","Michigan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2WUQNDYL","thesis","2009","Pezzeca, David","Depression, Social Isolation and Fantasy Role-Playing Game Use Among Young Adults: Comparing Tabletop to Videogame Formats","","","","","http://search.proquest.com/eric/docview/305176573/abstract/FDF766C916674BB6PQ/1","For over three decades, there has been much controversy surrounding the use of fantasy role-playing games. The media and other groups have linked the use of fantasy role-playing games to violence, suicide, murder, Satanic practices, and other detrimental outcomes. Video game fantasy role-playing games have also been blamed for causing players to become depressed, isolated and suicidal. Empirical research on the effects of fantasy role-playing games on players is inconclusive. Heavy use of these games has been linked to negative outcomes. There is little information regarding whether the negative outcomes found in some studies are based on the format of the game (pencil-and-paper versus video game) versus the content of these games. This study investigated whether there is a difference among self-reported feelings of loneliness and depressive symptomatology among young adult players of fantasy role-playing games based on their level of use (heavy versus light) and format preference. A 2 x 2 factorial design was employed to compare groups of players on measures of loneliness and depressive symptomatology. Based on a review of the research, it was hypothesized that players who report heavy use of the video game format would produce significantly higher scores on depression and loneliness measures than other groups. The results indicate that those participants expressing a preference for the video game format showed significantly higher scores on the depression measure than those who expressed a preference for the pencil-and-paper format, suggesting that depressive symptoms are more common among those who prefer video game to pencil-and-paper fantasy role-playing games. Those participants reporting heavy use of either format produced significantly higher scores on both the depression and loneliness measures than those reporting light use. The results of this study suggest that there could be some detrimental impact of excessive use of fantasy role-playing games on players' social relationships and mood but it is also possible that those who are depressed and isolated tend to engage in excessive game-playing. Some implications for treating isolated and depressed young adults who use games excessively are discussed.","2009","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2016-03-23 21:03:06","","126","","","","","Depression, social isolation and fantasy role-playing game use among young adults","","","","","Chestnut Hill College","Philadelphia, PA","en","Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2009","Ph.D. Psychology","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_mental disorder; _moral panic; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _problematic; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most often dice are used for this, but a few games use cards, rock-paperscissors or other means of randomization. There are dozens of different ways dice have been used in RPGs, and we are likely to see many more in the future. This is not an evolution from bad methods to better methods – there is no such thing as a perfect dice-roll system suitable for all games (though there are methods that are suitable for none). But how will a designer be able to decide which of the existing dice-roll method is best suited for his game, or when to invent his own? There is no recipe for doing this – it is in many ways an art. But like any art, there is an element of craft involved. This paper will attempt to provide some tools and observations that, hopefully, will give the reader some tools for the craftmanship involved in the art of choosing or designing dice-roll mechanisms for RPGs.","2006-03-28","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2016-05-26","","","","","","","","","","","","mimeo","","","","","","","","","","","","","_dice; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =ttttrpg; =PM-lu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Centred in the student, this term describe that the learner is experiencing something that, hopefully, contributes to a change in thinking, understanding, or behaviour afterwards. For this to happen, learning experiences should be active, meaningful, with social meaning, integrative, and diversified. We consider active learning experiences when the student has the main learning role. They should provide knowledge and skills that directly contribute to the learner's ability to perform more effectively in the context of workplace learning. Sharing and cooperation is fundamental, allowing the learner to interact with other active learners. The inherent increase in complexity demands the integration of different dimensions of knowledge, better achieved through diversified strategies. In this context, teaching and learning is more than the mere acquisition of content. It represents a process of learning by thinking-do-thinking. The learning experiences should be adequate to motivate the students and provide the necessary challenges for learning to take place. In this context, the concept is understood as a reinforcement of the goal of an educational interaction over its location (school, classroom) or format (course, program). The diversity of ways in which students can learn from and interact with teachers, in addition to the level of independence they may have when learning, is considerable. In this paper, we propose to include not only traditional transmissive approaches and practical work assignments but also designing and playing games. The latter is regarded as an integral part of the students' knowledge building, with the objective of being instructional with the main focus on the cognitive side of instruction. This approach is part of a broader pedagogical experience of applying gamification to a higher education subject in the course of computer science. It uses several game design mechanisms, such as adaptive challenges, rewards, curiosity and chance to increase the time students spend working, experiencing and learning. In addition to the award system that is being used to grade students, the learning experiences are also designed using game design patterns. We focus mainly in the design, development and assessment of a tabletop Role-Playing Game, with the purpose of providing an environment for reflection and concept learning regarding data survivability. The learning experience is evaluated through a specific Student Observation Record, evaluating the interaction between students, the dynamic of the learning experience and the overall learning degree.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","6987-6995","","","","","","","","","","","Iated-Int Assoc Technology Education a& Development","Valenica","en","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000376685707008","","","","_gamification; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _stem","design; framework","Gomez Chova, L.; Lopez Martinez, A.; Candel Torres, I.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most familiar surviving stories that connect us to our ancestors take the form of folklore and mythology. Games, too, have served many of the same functions as storytelling. In modern times, games and storytelling are no less prevalent, although the particular forms they take and functions they fulfill have been vastly expanded. Narrative gaming has become extremely popular, allowing for the consumption of both regional heritage and global multiculturalism. This essay will explore the roles of these contemporary narratives and provide an analysis of the transition from the traditional narrative to the live role-playing game.","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 02:28:02","2016-08-10 16:27:29","583-607","","6","11","","Games and Culture","","","","","","","","en","","","","0","gac.sagepub.com","","Number: 6 QID: Q57990091","","","https://doi.org/10.1177/1555412015574195","_storytelling; _anthropology; Cross Cultural Differences; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =blogged; =0.33; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =biblio:DNDP2018; =citation-alert:WOS; =PM-lu; _SOCIOLOGY","Culture; narrative; mythmaking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tool is explored from an archetypal orientation and its applicability for other theoretical orientations was also considered. An artistic-creative approach is employed and responses from five adult participants were analyzed for themes. TTRI combines group work, play therapy, and therapeutic role-play under one intervention, using the imaginal realm to explore the participants' experiences. Analysis of participant responses suggests that TTRI is functional and useful with therapeutic groups. The results also indicate that TTRI may allow for the exploration of conscious and unconscious factors of behaviors and thought process.","2011","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2016-09-02 17:53:10","","239","","","","","","","","","","Pacifica Graduate Institute","Carpinteria, CA","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A. Psychology","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among deficits previously identified by researchers working with students served through special education are delays in oral language development and greater externalization in locus of control, a construct of personality. This study investigates the effects of simulation game play upon remediation of these deficit areas. Participating in the study were 26 mildly handicapped adolescents. The experimental group, consisting of 13 students, played Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy-based role-playing game, during 18 sessions. All participants were administered individual tests utilizing the Utah Test of Language Development, Revised Edition and the Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Questionnaire after the final session of play. Findings and Conclusions. One-way analysis of variance tests using the difference between the group means on (1) oral language development and (2) internal versus external locus of control was applied. A significant difference was found to exist at the .05 level in oral language development. A significant difference was found to exist at the .05 level in internalization of locus of control. These findings tend to support the contention that a simulation game format is a viable remediation tool when used with mildly handicapped adolescents. Further, these findings support past research findings with both disabled and nondisabled participants.","1984","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2016-09-02 18:21:42","","88","","","","","","","","","","Oklahoma State University","Oklahoma","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Psychology","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_dnd; _disability; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High SE is linked to positive outcomes in diverse areas such as academics, health, and career. Therapeutic role play has been found to increase SE through mastery experiences, yet the correlation between roleplaying games (RPGs) and general and social SE has remained unexamined. In this study, the SE of gamers was examined for a statistically significant correlation between roleplaying activities and SE over that of the general, nonroleplaying population. A convenience sample of 414 adult gamers completed the General Self-efficacy Exam (GSE), Perceived Social Self-Efficacy scale (PSSE), and surveys of RPG activity and demographics. Findings showed a correlation between participation in RPGs and general SE [t(413) = 24.90, p <. 001], though not between RPGs and social SE. There was no overall correlation between time and general SE, though time was positively correlated with social SE (r = .083, p < .05). An ANOVA found that GMs have higher levels of both general [F(2, 411) = 30.92, p < .001] and social [F(2, 411) = 8.978, p < .001] SE than among individuals who were primarily players or who were equally players and GMs. The multidimensional importance of high SE throughout the life experience makes it vital to identify many avenues for improving SE. Knowledge of the correlation between RPGs and SE is an important contribution to existing literature, opening up the possibility of establishing a causal link between RPGs and SE through experimentation. Findings could enhance social change initiatives through identification of an inexpensive, easily-accessible, and enjoyable method for increasing SE across the lifespan.","2013","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:52:11","2016-09-02 18:42:32","","124","","","","","","","","","","Walden University","Minneapolis, MN","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Psychology","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_therapy; _self-efficacy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research was centred around the question: to what extent has the non-institutionalized use of Role-Playing Games affected students' academic engagement and self-efficacy? This research was undertaken in order to investigate potential uses of the Role-Playing Game as an instructional tool. Mixed-methods research was employed, involving surveys regarding the amount of games played, student interviews, and teacher interviews. It was found that RPG use and self-efficacy were significantly positively correlated, RPG use and academic engagement were weakly to moderately negatively correlated, and that RPG use did not significantly impact the desire to learn. Recurring responses to interviews cited interactivity and ownership of narrative as factors contributing to RPG use by students.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:52:11","2016-09-02 18:43:59","","140","","","","","Level 10 Human Student","","","","","University of New Brunswick","Fredericton, NB","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Master of Education","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_curriculum; _self-efficacy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _empirical work; _computer rpg; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is in contrast to the way that the vision and creativity of famous designers (e.g. Steve Jobs, Burt Rutan, Dean Kamen, etc.) are admired and celebrated. How do we help students to develop their creativity and incorporate their voice into the process? How can we also help them to improve the quality of the ideas that they inject into the design process? A course in creativity and creativity techniques was developed as a prototype to test creativity teaching techniques for subsequent incorporation into a capstone design sequence. The primary creativity mechanism was to utilize art both as a prism for new ways of seeing and as a vehicle to explore design in collaboration with the Barnes Foundation of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. Students in this course explored techniques to help them find their creative core and ways to use art as a prism to see engineering design from multiple perspectives. To achieve these learning goals and to free students from potential self-limiting behaviors in discussing non-technical matters, role-playing as part of a popular role-playing game was utilized to enable students to approach creativity and creativity techniques from their character's perspective. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","","","2016-June","","","Work in progress","","","","","","","en","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","_creativity; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Während in Computerrollenspielen Avatare durch CGI-Umgebungen gesteuert werden, vollzieht sich die Handlung hier durch Beschreibung und ein Improvisationstheater-ähnliches Darstellen. Die diegetischen Wirklichkeiten sind dabei nicht nur inspiriert von verschiedensten Medien, Genres, und Epochen – sei es der »Herr der Ringe« oder die Heian-Zeit (794 – 1185) – sondern stehen in einem Spannungsverhältnis zu Praktiken und Kategorien, die entscheidend für die Herstellung und Aufrechterhaltung der ›normalen‹ Realität außerhalb des Spiels sind. Geschlecht und die Unterscheidung in Mann und Frau gehören zu derartigen Kategorien und damit verbundenen Praktiken. Wie verhält sich das doing gender am Spieltisch zu Geschlechterkategorien und -handlungen außerhalb des Spiels? Ist eine solche Trennung überhaupt möglich und sinnvoll ? Mit Fokus auf Tischrollenspiele in Japan und basierend auf der Analyse von qualitativen Interviews und teilnehmender Beobachtung untersucht der vorliegende Beitrag Geschlecht als ›beiläufige Realität‹ (collateral reality), die in teilweise verbundenen, alltäglichen und spielerischen Kontexten ›getan‹ wird. Das Cross-Gender-Spiel von Rollenspielerinnen und -spielern eröffnet Einblicke in die Stabilisierung von Geschlechtergrenzen – beispielsweise durch geschlechtskonnotierte Sprache, die außerhalb des Spiels als überholt gelten mag, im Spiel jedoch Authentizität schafft – und macht dabei deutlich, dass keine singuläre Größe wie ›die japanische Gesellschaft‹ als Explanans fungieren kann, sondern dass Geschlecht in einem vernetzten und interdependenten Wechselverhältnis von Spiel und Wirklichkeit produziert wird.","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:12:40","2016-10-13 19:49:09","273-303","","","","","","Cross-Gender Table-Talk-RPG auf Japanisch; oder","Geschlecht und Gesellschaft","62","","","Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden","","de","©2016 Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden","","","","link.springer.com","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-658-10063-6_11","","","","_gender; sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","Mae, Michiko; Scherer, Elisabeth; Hülsmann, Katharina","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dieses Buch beschäftigt sich mit dem sozialpädagogischen Einsatz der sogenannten ,Pen & Paper'-Rollenspiele. Als Zielgruppe wurde speziell die späte Kindheit gewählt, denn Fantasy Rollenspiele können die Entwicklung von Kindern positiv beeinflussen. Der Leitfaden richtet sich an Sozialarbeiter, Pädagogen und weitere interessierte Personen aus dem Feld der Kinder- und Jugendarbeit, die nicht nur die Grundzüge des Rollenspiels nachlesen möchten. Der methodische Teil ist mit Beispielen direkt aus der Praxis durchsetzt und bietet somit die Möglichkeit das Konzept mit geringen Vorbereitungen selbst anzuwenden.","2011","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:12:40","","","128","","","","","Würfelschwert und Federrüstung","","","","","Akademische Verlagsgemeinschaft München","München","de","","","","","Amazon","","","","","","sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _yo1-12; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As  such, we  endeavor to  investigate  the  ongoing  research  regarding  these  games,  as  it  is  carried  out  in Brazil,  in  order  to  achieve  a  better  understanding  of  the methodology  that  has  been applied  to  the  study  of  this  brand-new  subject  of  science. Since  we  notice  a  trend  towards  marginalization  of  role-playing  games  – an outlook  that  could  curtail  initiatives  regarding  the application  of  RPGs  to  the  teaching-learning  process – we  consider  it  necessary  to  demystify  them;  therefore, pieces  of news  disclosed  by  the  media,  implying  a  connection  between  RPGs,  crime  and magic  rituals,  are  analysed;  materials  issued  by  religious  institutions  in  which  that connection  is  punctuated  are  scrutinized  as  well.  To  grasp  this  uneasy  relationship between  role-playing  games  and  religion,  we  refer  to  Max  Weber’s  concept  of disenchantment of the world, and  by  doing  so  we  infer  the  association  of  RPGs  to scientific  thinking – an  enlightening  conclusion  that  has  enabled  us  to  understand  the conflict  between  scientific  and  religious  thinking. Besides  discussing  these  preliminary  issues,  we  identify  in  role-playing  games some  features  from  Michael  Löwy  and  Robert Sayre’s Romantic Anti-Capitalism, a perspective  that  allowed  us  to  understand  certain  traits  of  these  games,  traits  that enable  an  educative  experience  in  contradiction  with  the semi-formation  offered  by Cultural  Industry,  by  proposing  an  action  grounded  in  the  partakers’  Experience (Erfahrung), instead  of  the  typical  commodities  of  the Cultural  Industry  that  are  based in  the  viewers’  Lived Experience  (Erlebnis).  We  also  deal  with  one  of  the  subject’s  particulars  we consider  most  significant: that  role-players  might  cast  a  non-deterministic  look  upon  the  history,  because  the tale  presents  itself  open  to transformation,  and  it  is  a collective  achievement  that denaturalizes  the  social  sphere.  Finally,  we  advocate  the  possibility  of  imbuing  role-players with  a  specific habitus , one  that  spurs  them  to  actively  acquire  reading  practice  and  cultural  capital","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:11:28","2016-10-13 20:12:25","","180","","","","","","","","","","Universidade Estadual Paulista","Sao Paulo","pt","","Mestre em Educação Escolar","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _yo1-12; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this master ́s thesis is to examine role-playing literature as phenomenon in libraries through librarians ́ attitudes. The paper is based on qualitative interviews with eight librarians: one personal interview with two librarians and six e-mail interviews with six librarians at different libraries. The paper starts with a definition of the term ”role-playing game”, its different categories and genres and a description of its background. We also discuss the debate about role-playing games and their position in society. We use Pierre Bourdieu ́s theories about habitus, capital and taste and apply them to the librarians’ attitude towards users  and literature. We place role-playing literature at the same level as popular literature. We describe the history of popular  literature and the criticism against it and focus on fantasy literature. The scientific aspect of popular literature, in which we place role-play literature as well, has become more acceptable during the latest decades. The result of this paper shows that the librarians have a positive attitude towards role-playing literature at libraries and they feel that it can stimulate  creativity and traditional reading as well as own writing.  It can also attract people who don’t visit libraries regularly. The future of role-playing literature depends on the librarians’  willingness to familiarize themselves with the benefits and drawbacks of role-playing games and also how they market  the games to their colleagues and the market of users.","2007","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:17:03","2016-10-13 20:20:32","","67","","","","","“The die is cast”: Roleplay literature in society and at  libraries","","","","","University of Boras","Boras","sw","","Master Information Science","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _LEARNING; _LIBRARY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Im Fall des phantastischen Rollenspiels wird das Überschreiten der Grenze zu diesen andren Welten zum Leitmotiv – als Raum, der nicht im Sinne z.B. einer ausgeschriebenen Text- oder Filmwelt fixiert ist, ermöglicht dieses Medium wie kein anderes die Entgrenzung der phantastischen Welt, die es in sich entwirft.

Aus wissenstypologischer und -soziologischer Perspektive fehlen bisher Ansätze, die uns diese Leistung verständlich machen können. Die hier vorgestellte explorative und hypothesen-generierende Studie untersucht die Weisen wie Wissen im Rollenspiel erzeugt, verwendet, verteilt und bewertet wird, und dadurch in die Konstruktion von Wirklichkeit und Fiktion in diesem Spiel eingeht – kurz: die Typen des in Rollenspielen vorkommenden Wissens. Die dafür relevanten Kategorien werden sowohl empirisch-induktiv aus qualitativen Interviews mit Rollenspielern wie auch theoretisch-deduktiv aus der bestehenden Forschungsliteratur über Rollenspiel gewonnen und in einer Proto-Theorie systematisiert. Gemäss dieser Proto-Theorie können die in Rollenspielen verwendeten Wissensinhalte unter den drei Wissens-Metatypen „Personen-Wissen“, „Rollenspieler-Wissen“ und „Charakter-Wissen“ subsumiert werden. Dies erlaubt es, das Interaktionsverhältnis formal verschiedener Wissensinhalte beim erforderlichen Aktivieren, Bewerten und Ausblenden dieses Wissens in dem komplexen Kommunikationsprozess, an dem die Teilnehmenden partizipieren, theoretisch zu erschliessen. Zudem lässt sich die Proto-Theorie empirisch anwenden, um die tatsächliche Interaktion im Rollenspiel zu analysieren und z.T. zu erklären. Diese Anwendung wird in der Studie exemplarisch anhand von transkribierten Tonband-Mitschnitten einer Rollenspielsitzung erfolgreich durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse der Studie legen nahe, dass bei dieser Interaktion ein eigentliches Wissensmanagement sowohl des Einzelnen als auch der ganzen Rollenspielergruppe erforderlich ist. Dabei spielen sowohl explizite wie auch implizite Regulierungen auf Basis zugesprochener und gewachsener Autorität und damit verbundener Legitimität des eingesetzten Wissens eine Rolle. Durch diese Aushandlungsprozesse werden zwei eigenständige Spielwirklichkeiten konstruiert – die soziale Wirklichkeit des Rollenspielens und die fiktive Wirklichkeit der Spielwelt –, die als Bezugsrahmen für sinnvolle Handlungen der Rollenspieler als Rollenspieler und als Charakter fungieren und mithin Rollenspielen überhaupt erst ermöglichen. Die in dieser Studie generierten Hypothesen dazu bilden mögliche Anknüpfungspunkte für weiterführende Forschung.","2010","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:12:40","","","167","","","","","Wissen und Wissen-lassen - Wissenstypen und Wissensverteilung im Pen-and-Paper-Rollenspiel","","","","","GRIN Verlag","München","de","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6gRvEf5H6PIC","","","","_anthropology; sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our focus of analysis is mainly concerned with relationships between the subjective dimensions of desire and alterity, as opened by the participants’ symbolic actions addressed to the future. In such an extent, we looked for ruptures in the actors’ seek to intersubjective sharing, brought about their dialogical interactions. These ruptures were usually accompanied by the reorganization of the actors’ subjective experiences through symbolic resources. As a result, we propose an interpretive frame about the dynamic elements encompassed by the actor’s dialogical relationships. We could apprehend the presence of otherness in the symbolic configurations constructed by the I. In such an extent, we can say that the meaning of personal constructions were mainly addressed to the otherness, with whom the I tried to have a shared ground of meaning.

Diese Studie bietet eine umfassende Darstellung von Geschichte, Gestalt und Praxis des Fantasy-Rollenspiels. Mit Hilfe interdisziplinärer literatur- und spieltheoretischer Methoden wird der Frage nachgegangen, inwiefern sich die unterschiedlichen Aspekte des Rollenspiels voneinander abgrenzen bzw. als Einzelelemente beschreiben lassen. Geboten wird ein Überblick über die Entstehung und Fortentwicklung einer neuen literarischen Gattung im Spannungsfeld zwischen Spielen und Erzählen. Eine Betrachtung unter erzähltheoretischen Gesichtspunkten zeigt, dass Rollenspiele nicht allein Spiele sind, sondern auch ein erzählerisches Potential von hohem Stellenwert besitzen. Von besonderem Interesse ist zudem die Verbindung von Simulation und Narration, die in dieser Form bei keiner anderen literarischen Gattung zu finden ist. Eine vergleichende Untersuchung mehrerer verbreiteter Rollenspiel-Systeme erlaubt Aufschluss über Wesen und Charakter der Gattung sowohl aus narratologischer als auch aus ludologischer Perspektive.","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:12:40","","","403","","","","","Zwischen Simulation und Narration","","","","","Peter Lang","Frankfurt am Main","de","","","","","Amazon","","","","","","sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These recordings will be selectively transcribed. A web site will be constructed which will facilitate IRB and thesis committee monitoring as well as disseminate all findings. Guiding theory is arranged into the domains of Performance, Bricolage, Double-Voiced Discourse and Idioculture. I intend to challenge the idea that tabletop role-play involves a degenerative, limited type of performance. I want to explore the ways in which game participants use double-voiced discourse and strategies of persuasion during game events. I want to examine game structures such as adventures and character speech acts as if they were bricolage; are there patterns in the types of creative collages I will encounter? Considering the amount of context specific frames that role-players use and create during their games (Idioculture), my 18-year familiarity with role-playing games is an asset. This thesis project will not only extend an anthropological foothold into a relatively unexplored type of speech event, it will also significantly improve the existing body of theory which describes and explains role-playing games generally. Research will conclude with a public thesis defense in Fall 2005.","2005","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2016-10-18","","124","","","","","","","","","","Northern Arizona University","Flagstaff","","","Master Anthropology","","","","","","","","","sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evangelical gamers, have to negotiate criticisms and carve out a social space for themselves among their fellow-believers as Christians who play RPGs. The chapter explores both the strategies used to maintain them and the potential dissonances and ambivalences that they engender. It is divided into two main sections. In the first, the author presents a brief overview of the evangelical critique of role-playing games (RPGs) that emerged in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Secondly, following on from this, he draws on a range of primary materials and interviews with gamers themselves to examine the ways in which evangelical Christian gamers attempt to both respond to these critiques and create a specifically Christian space within the role-playing community.","2012-03-28","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2016-10-19 14:44:55","205-223","","","","","","The Road to Hell is Paved with D20s","","","","","Brill","Leiden","en","","","","","CrossRef","","Chapter DOI: 10.1163/9789004226944_012","","","","_moral panic; _religion; sourceTanelorn; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","Possamai, Adam","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The book deals with the history of games and their relation to religions, the links between divination and games, the relations between sport and ritual, the pedagogical functions of games in religious education, and the interaction between games, media and religions. Richly illustrated, the book contributes to the study of religions, to ritual, game and media studies, and addresses an academic as well as a general public.

Dabei werden von Laien immer wieder ""Rollenspiele""  als Schuldige ausgemacht, wobei indifferenziert Online-Spiele jeglicher Art gemeint werden. Tatsächlich existieren dagegen seit den 1970er Jahren Pen  & Paper-Rollenspiele, die abseits vom Mainstream ohne elektronische Hilfsmittel alleine durch Sprache und Vorstellungskraft durchgeführt werden. Diese phantasievollen Spiele wendeten schon konstruktivistische Methoden an, bevor diese von der interaktionistisch-konstruktivistischen Pädagogik entdeckt wurden. Dieses Phänomen wird erstmals aus der Sicht der Kunstpädagogik auf sein kreatives Potential hin untersucht.

On étudie ici différentes manifestations de plaisir esthétique liées à l’expérience des jeux, indépendamment de leur ornementation visuelle ou sonore. Pour les jeux abstraits, on identifie trois motifs : le sublime qui reflète notre incapacité à embrasser l’immensité d’une combinatoire, le subtil qui se révèle lors de la résolution d’énigmes originales ou difficiles, et le merveilleux qui découle de la découverte de propriétés inattendues du système.

Ainsi, les jeux de rôle font de la réception une étape de création de la fiction. Mais peuvent-ils être considérés comme une forme de jeu littéraire oral et collectif ? Pour répondre à cette question, cet article analyse dans un premier temps le rapport qu’entretiennent littérature et jeu d’une façon générale. Ensuite, il étudie le JdR en tant que processus conversationnel, oral et « présentifié » qui génère une création fictionnelle collective.

The first part of the theoretical reference of this work presents the history of roleplaying games (RPG) in the U.S. and Brazil and some studies on RPG in the U.S. and Europe. Based on these studies, IT provides a definition of RPG and its five types: table-top RPG, Larp, solo adventure, electronic solo RPG and MMORPG. In the second part of the theoretical reference, the arguments are about the concepts of Vygotsky and his theories in Brazil, some concepts of the Vygotskyan theory, their contributions to education and a reading of the RPG from Vygotsky. The methodology is the concept of state of the art and a possible reading of this concept from Vygotsky for the basis of the procedures of bibliographic survey and analysis of material collected. This was divided into three categories: educational material, books, theses and dissertations. Only those dissertations and theses were selected that have Vygotsky in its theoretical reference. The analyses address the production on RPG in Brazil and the difficulty of access to such production. The aim was to map the concepts of education that permeate the work on RPG in Brazil, in addition to relating some of them to the technicistic pedagogy. It also analyses the material on its use by educators as well as books, dissertations and theses on the assimilation of Vygotskyan theories. There is a need on the part of educators and researchers to take a critical position to address the RPG, and to have clarity in the design of man and society that permeates their practice. It was also discovered that the theories of Vygotsky are little known and exploited.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:11:28","","","285","","","","","","","","","","Universidade Estadual de Londrina","Londrina, PR","pt","","Mestrado em Educação","","","","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Vampire legends can be found in Mesopotamian cultures and in early Greek myths, as well as the blood-drinking spirits of Chinese and Japanese civilisations. These stories were particularly relevant in the folklore of Eastern Europe, and spread from there, first in the form of travelling tales in the 16th- and 17th-centuries, and then formalized as the gothic tales and melodramas of the romantic imagination in the late 18th and early 19th-centuries, coinciding with the re-structuring of society and the emergence of industrialization. Most scholars have argued that these stories reflected unconscious community fears at a time of rapid social changes. The vampire is one of the emblems of the Gothic exploration of the monstrous. It represents the inhuman and the undead. A monster of the night that lives at the expense of other living creatures. Contemporary works of modern and postmodern horror maintain, in many cases, similar iconographies while incorporating some changes to the figure of the vampire. Closely associated with technological advance, the vampire took on new attributes with the emergence of cinematography. One of the first a most famous movies in this regard is 1922 Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror) by the German expressionist F.W. Murnau.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-03-04 14:30:14","","67-82","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 2","","","","_literature; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _PSYCHOLOGY; _wod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subject and methods: This research focuses on the practice effects of “Pixels” and “Passerelle” workshops at CThA. It is about the use of video games as a therapeutic tool, mobilizing of the symptomatology of the teenager. Results: “Pixels” workshops use playing according to three specific forms: the paper role-play game, the video game, and the cards playing game. Their specificity is that the participative adult shows a regressive ability strong enough to play with teenagers and is very careful to not interpret what takes place within. Conclusions: “Passerelle” workshops demonstrate the link between the teenager’s mind and the use of his own virtual avatar. It allows to evolve from a “play together” to a “talk together”, a moment of symbolization and of being able to stand back in regards to his or her own recreational activities.

"WXGFZIU5","thesis","2009","Bowman, Sarah Lynne","Role-playing: An ethnographic exploration","","","","","http://search.proquest.com/docview/304419708","This volume explores the various social and psychological functions of role-playing, with a specific emphasis on role-playing games. I posit that the activity of role-playing finds its roots in essential aspects of human social behavior, including childhood pretend play, storytelling, and ritual. The subcultural practice of role-playing games emerged from these age-old practices, but also from several cultural shifts inherent to American life in the latter half of the twentieth century. These shifts include culture-wide paradigm shifts regarding diversity, religion, and alternative lifestyles; an increased interest in the fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres; the heightened sense of cynicism and self-awareness characteristic of Generation X; and the large-scale technological advances characteristic of the computer and information age. While these cultural shifts specifically contributed to the popularity of role-playing games as a subculture, people engage in the practice of role-playing in a variety of different contexts, including business, education, military training, improvisational theater, drama therapy, health care, and leisure. The practice of role-playing offers three basic functions. First, role-playing enhances a group‘s sense of communal cohesiveness by providing narrative enactment within a ritual framework. Second, role-playing often encourages complex problem-solving and provides participants with the opportunity to learn an extensive array of skills through the enactment of scenarios. Third, role-playing offers participants a safe space to enact alternate personas through a process known as identity alteration. This volume explores these three concepts with regard to the various forms of role-playing. The study then offers a detailed, participant-observer ethnography involving extensive, qualitative interviews with nineteen respondents. I conclude that the benefits offered by role-playing in more traditional environments are also offered through the leisure activity of role-playing games. Though mainstream American media channels often dismisses involvement in role-playing games as escapist and potentially dangerous, this volume posits the notion that role-playing encourages creativity, self-awareness, empathy, group cohesion, and “out-of-the-box” thinking. The role-playing game platform facilitates the development of various cognitive and social skills that remain useful in the “real world.” Thus, participation in role-playing games should incur a lesser amount of stigma from the larger culture.","2009","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:52:11","2017-03-06","","312","","","","","Role-playing","","","","","The University of Texas at Dallas","Dallas, TX","en","","Ph.D. (Humanities) Performance Studies and Aesthetic Studies","","","","","","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scholars and teachers alike are only now beginning to look at RPGs as instructional tools, works of art, and means of self-expression and representation. Lately, there has been a quest to discover how online games allow players to explore otherwise hidden parts of their persona, how shooting games integrate physics into their designs, and how RPGs can be considered as interactive narratives. According to Quijano (December 2007), when students play RPGs, they “take the role of characters in a story, and together with the teacher (or game master) they create a cooperative narrative while following a system of preset rules.” Currently, there are very few articles or books dealing with role playing games as narrative media, interactive simulations, or potential instructional resources. This paper will focus on role playing games as interactive narratives and as potential language classroom resources, and will specifically demonstrate that student exposure to RPGs results in the amelioration of the second and foreign language acquisition process.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:07:07","","1-10","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 1","","","","_language learning; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _benefits of rpg; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Edgework, as defined by Stephen Lyng, occurs when people voluntarily tread boundaries to gain emotional rewards. Based on nineteen months of participant-observation in a gaming group, twenty in-depth interviews, and archival data from e-mail lists and websites, I show how gamers gained many of the benefits that traditional edgeworkers, like extreme sports participants, obtain without the physical danger. Participants tread the boundaries of sanity/insanity and order/disorder, prepared for their edgework, and sustained an illusion of control. By playing a game, they felt alive and powerful, yet removed the edge, thus engaging in “virtual edgework.” In contrast to previous studies, I show that what makes an activity edgework is not the type of risk but how the experience is structured. I suggest that future scholars need to consider new avenues for edgework as people’s lives move online.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-13 01:52:57","2017-04-18 13:22:54","203-229","","2","46","","Journal of Contemporary Ethnography","Virtual Edgework","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Number: 2 QID: Q106319629","","","https://doi.org/10.1177/0891241615603448","_anxiety; _well-being; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _sex-transgressive; =rabbit; =blogged; =0.66; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =biblio:DNDP2018; =citation-alert:WOS; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, practices akin to role-playing and simulation is quite a bit older as tools for learning or social meaning making, but after the birth of Dungeons and Dragons the hobby community quickly took up this more serious mantle as well. Looking to a few unfortunate cases, and the obvious psychological power of role playing experience, many came to believe that role playing can have a profound psychological impact, but few evidence based studies have been published (for a review, see Lieberoth & Trier-Knudsen, 2015). Sometimes the therapeutic concept of “”Psychodrama”” is evoked as an earlier 20th century case (and suggested efficacy) of role playing as a positive tool for personal and psychological change, but digging a bit deeper, it turns out that early 20th century social psychologists conducted quite a few experiments of the effects of taking on alien roles and perspectives on attitudes and personality (Bowman & Lieberoth, in review). This presentation reviews what a hundred years of forgotten non-gaming psychology studies revealed about the effects of roleplaying – long before LARP and Dungeons and Dragons.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 20:08:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Hobro","","","","","","","","","","","","_therapy; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =PM-lu; _PSYCHOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 International eduLARP conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"JKHIUFX3","thesis","2015","Mizer, Nicholas J.","The Greatest Unreality: Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Experience of Imagined Worlds","","","","","http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/156154","Drawing on four years of participant observation, interviews, and game recordings, this dissertation explores the collaborative experience of imagined worlds in tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Research on tabletop games has at times been myopic in terms of time depth and geographic scope, and has often obscured the ethnographic realities of gaming communities. This research expands the ethnographic record on tabletop role-playing games and uses a phenomenological approach to carefully examine how gamers at five sites across the United States structure their experience of imagined worlds in the context of a productive tension between enchantment and rationalization.  After discussing the history of Dungeons & Dragons in terms of enchantment and rationalization, the dissertation presents three case studies, each exploring a different facet of experience in imagined worlds. At a convention in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, gamers commemorate the life of Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Gary Gygax, but also their own childhoods and a sense of a lost, imagined pre-modern world. The experience of time in the game connects that perduring world with the imagined world of the game. Having explored the relationships between commemoration, nostalgia, and the experience of imagined worlds, the dissertation moves on to consider how the imagined worlds of gaming enter the experience of players. The techniques and theories of performance utilized by a gamer in Denton, Texas portray performances in gaming, psychedelic rock, and abstract analog video art as ""kidnapping reality” through the use of color, song, and choice diction to convey both affect and imaginary things into the physical spaces of her performances. The final case study considers gamers in New York City and Portland, Connecticut, where two groups have developed the imaginary worlds of their games over many years. The dissertation argues that gamers in these groups come to experience the imagined world as increasingly concrete and complex over time, and that their sustained interactions with it develop into a strong sense of what Heidegger called dwelling.","2015-09-29","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2017-04-28 18:07:16","","","","","","","The Greatest Unreality","","","","","Texas A&M University","College Station, TX","en","","Thesis","","","oaktrust.library.tamu.edu","","","","","","_dnd; _anthropology; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The potential of digital games tocontribute in this way is being increasingly recognized, but the author argues that those interested inthe convergence of games, ethics, and education should more fully consider analog games (i.e., gameswithout a digital component). This argument draws from a qualitative study that focused on the use ofan analog roleplaying game in an undergraduate activity that explored ethical issues related to politics,society, and culture. The results of this study are examined through an educational technology lens,which suggests that games (like other educational resources) afford and constrain learning and teachingin certain ways. These results demonstrate that this game afforded and constrained ethics education inboth ways similar to digital games and ways unique to analog games. © 2016 by IGI Global.

Performance is how the role-playing game is performed by the players. And Narrative is the storyline of the role-playing game. The model seeks to connect rather than tear these four parts and does this by the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk which means that indeed all the parts should work together as a whole work of art. Another concept is the Wunderkammer which means cabinet of curiosities. In this context the role-playing game is seen as a Wunderkammer and every item, concept, or idea put into this Wunderkammer is somehow changed by the relation to the other curiosities of the Wunderkammer. Furthermore, the Wu-Ge Model presents a structure based on two dichotomies: Concrete vs. Abstract and Action vs. Contemplation. Performance and Narrative belong to the Concrete, while Ludus and Sub-Creation belong to the Abstract. Performance and Ludus belong to Action, while Sub-Creation and Narrative belong to Contemplation. This means that the role-playing game wavers between the abstract and the concrete and between active and contemplative states. The aim of the article is to show how this knowledge can be used to not only analyse role-playing games but use it as a way to design role-playing games as well. The Wu-Ge Model helps define role-playing games and understand how they work as Wunderkammer and Gesamtkunstwerk.","2015-05","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2017-05-16 13:43:30","","","","","","","The Wunderkammer-Gesamtkunstwerk Model","","","","","DIGRA","Lüneburg","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_rpg theory; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digra 2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Author Jeffro Johnson, an expert role-playing gamer, accomplished Dungeon Master and three-time Hugo Award Finalist, critically reviews all 43 works and authors listed by Gygax in the famous appendix. In doing so, he draws a series of intelligent conclusions about the literary gap between past and present that are surprisingly relevant to current events, not only in the fantastic world of role-playing, but the real world in which the players live.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","352","","","","","","","","","","Castalia House","Kouvola","en","","","","","Amazon","","","","","","_literature; _dnd; _TTRPG; _appendixN; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _LIBRARY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Online RPG environments are open to critique due to the seemingly wide-spread use of hostility as a gate-keeping tactic. Numerous studies and digital media scholars have examined how bullying, harassment, and bodily threats present within toxic digital gaming cultures act as a means of limiting access to participation. Because marginalized players, whether due to gender, race, or sexual identity, are often playing in gaming environments that get coded as toxic, this dissertation chooses to interrogate the ways in which some players negotiate game environments that are complicated at best and overtly hostile at worst. While the dissertation is careful to note the distinctions between online RPGs and offline table-top RPGs, the core argument made stems from the consistencies present between both: both the online and table-top groups who participated in the study use tools of intimacy both actively and passively as a means of fostering individual as well as group identity. In so doing, the use of intimacy acts as a buffer against hostile acts that would otherwise inhibit participation. But this dissertation does not just attempt to understand how players weather and negotiate hostility outside of their gaming groups. It also seeks to understand how some players are able to absorb the hostility and redirect it as a creative play-style. In this case, ""playing ugly"" becomes a means of performance not directed outward, but rather, inward. Taboo play, in this case, becomes a cathartic way in which players process hostility by becoming hostile. While this play-style may seem to mirror the online toxic environments that can further separate marginalized players from a larger online gaming ecology, playing ugly strives to make its members immune to the aggression-although whether that achievement is attainable is tenuous.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2017-07-27 17:54:57","","239","","","","","Constructing Elysium and playing ugly","","","","","Bowling Green State University","Bowling Green, OH","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. American Culture Studies","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_bleed; _fandom; _gender; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TRPG characters, like all aspects of personality, exist at the junction of mythical, psychological, and sociological forces. Unlike other personae, TRPG characters exist within alternative realities deliberately crafted from heroic mythology, which feature group-centered behavior at their core. By examining differences between character and player perspectives, especially the group based norm of heroism common across many kinds of TRPGs, the importance of studying TRPG characters as personae in their own right is emphasized. The dissertation concludes with ways for TRPG scholars to increase emphasis on TRPG character studies, and with ways for non-TRPG studies to benefit from an increased emphasis on personae play as an important aspect of psychosocial growth, especially with regard to how heroism is understood in American culture.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2017-07-27 17:59:58","","276","","","","","Tabletop role-playing game characters","","","","","California Institute of Integral Studies","San Francisco, CA","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Transformative Studies","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _SOCIOLOGY","Role-playing; Psychology; Social sciences; Hero's journey; Heroism; Persona","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knowledge regarding the stereotype and its implications is very scarce specifically among mental health practitioners. Therefore the present study aimed to narrow this gap in knowledge by examining the perception of Social Workers that are considered to be the forefront of mental health-care, in regard to the association between playing RPGs and mental health. A convenience sample of 130 Social Workers, recruited through social networks (e.g. Facebook, WhatsApp etc.), responded to an on-line survey dealing with their perception of their own knowledge on RPGs, the importance of such knowledge and the association between playing RPGs and mental illness. Results indicated an association between having higher knowledge of RPGs and lower perception of a link between playing RPGs and psychopathology. The study's findings emphasize the false stigma and its potential harmful implication on professionals' practice, especially in the context of intake process and primary diagnostic. The effect of familiarity is also discussed in light of the study's findings. HIGHLIGHTS: • The perception of mental health professionals toward role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons is understudied. • Social Workers' perception was measured in regard to the connection between use of RPGs and DSM-IV-TR psychopathology. • Greater knowledge of RPGs was found to be associated with lower perception of the connection between use of RPGs and DSM-IV-TR psychopathology.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:27:28","","213-218","","1","89","","Psychiatr Q","","","","","","","","en","","","","0","PubMed","","Number: 1 PMID: 28808830 qid: Q47646638","","","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28808830","_therapy; _attitude change; _moral panic; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =blogged; =0.99; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =biblio:DNDP2018; =citation-alert:WOS; =PM-lu; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their distinct anatomical characteristics and the variations therein among the recognized “species” of dragons make the taxa appropriate models for basic phylogenetic analysis in an undergraduate general biology or systematics class. The wyvern, an obviously more primitive, distant cousin of the “true” dragons, is also an appropriate outgroup for these estimations of shared evolutionary history. Separating metallic from chromatic dragons, the generated tree shows relationships among the species that are consistent with their separation in the Dungeons & Dragons games according to alignment, scale color, and religion, three characters that are not used in the analysis. Manual construction of a character matrix and cladogram of dragons followed by repetition of this process via conventional computer software allows the students to track their progress not only in terms of understanding such concepts as choice of character states and parsimony but also in terms of the applicability of said software.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-18 01:38:19","2017-10-03 13:48:52","544-551","","7","79","","The American Biology Teacher","Here Be Dragons","","","","","","","en","","","","","bioone.org (Atypon)","","Number: 7 QID: Q114712635","","","https://doi.org/10.1525/abt.2017.79.7.544","_dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =blogged; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =p0; =PM-lu; _LEARNING; _stem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two questions drove this research: (1) What motivates people to play TRPGs and (2) Can a single supra-motivator be developed which envelopes a larger theory of why people participate in TRPGs? Grounded Theory methodology was used to investigate why people initiate and continue to participate in table-top role-playing games. Fourteen people who attended a 4-year college who played TRPGs and two people who did not play were interviewed regarding their participation in role-playing games. Open codes, emergent categories, conceptual categories, and a theoretical category indicated there exist two conceptual categories related to why people initiate participation in TRPGs and five conceptual categories related to why people continue to play TRPGs. These categories were linked together to develop the theoretical category of “becoming” to explain the motivations of people who play TRPGs. The emergent theory of becoming as motivation, limitations, and future directions for research are discussed within the interpretive context and research context. © 2017: Darrin F.

This dissertation will examine an underappreciated element of gaming's pedagogical history through thinking about English composition education as a kind of gaming. Whereas much recent research about gaming has focused on the promises of digital games, I will focus on an older and more fluid type of gaming represented by Tabletop Role Playing Games. In the modern day, Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPGs), like the well-known game Dungeons & Dragons, represent a combination of traditional and innovative play that foreshadows where and how educators might make use of play-based learning. In my first chapter, I will present the evolution and history of TRPGs from strategic wargaming into a higher and more complex form of general interactive simulation and gameplay. In so doing, I will demonstrate that games and play are an inherently educational form of activity, and have always been so in almost every manifestation. In my second chapter, I take a closer look at gameplay, and what makes it motivational, social, and effective as a form of pedagogy that could be readily incorporated into the classroom. I highlight the three most pertinent advantages which TRPGs can offer to modern students and educators: the harnessing of student engagement, the encouraging of role-play and personal agency-driven learning, and the creation of authentic contexts within which learning may take place. In my third chapter, I offer the composition classroom as a perfect example of a learning context wherein game-based learning can be of use to students and educators. I note the ways in which TRPGs benefit compositional learning, particularly in the case of the First-Year Writing and genre-based composition courses in higher education. In my fourth chapter, I present a model for introducing TRPGs into the composition classroom, using The Quiet Year as a structural example for a First-Year Writing course activity. I conclude by describing my own experiences running TRPGs in educational environments, and the benefits which such a game-based approach can offer.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-28 15:10:40","2017-11-29 14:54:38","","214","","","","","Anything can be attempted","","","","","St. John's University","Jamaica, NY","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. English","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","1961211564","ProQuest","","ISBN: 978-0-355-44371-4 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses 10702793","","","","_language learning; Role playing; _literature; _writing; _dnd; Education; Higher education; _TTRPG; 0279:Language arts; 0593:British and Irish literature; 0681:Rhetoric; British & Irish literature; Computer modeling and simulation; English; Game-Based Learning; Games and Pedagogy; Historical text analysis; Language and Games; Language arts; Language, literature and linguistics; Learning environment; Playing; Rhetoric; Tabletop Role-Playing Games; Writing; Writing instruction; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this sense, they inherit much of their structure from Tolkien’s idea of sub-creation. However, along with this creative freedom, RPGs contain rote rules and restrictions that must be followed. This paradox creates an intrinsic tension that players are forced to deal with. Rather than casting off restrictions, or punishing players that do not submit, gamers need to understand the purpose and necessity of rules, and be empathetic towards other players when they have difficulty following the dictates of a gaming manual. If these principles are followed, then true sub-creation can take place, and players can enter fully into a secondary world.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2017-11-29 14:55:03","","66","","","","","Playing God","","","","","The University of Alabama at Birmingham","Birmingham, AL","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A. Literature","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_language learning; _worldbuilding; _mechanics; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a genre, TRPGs are characterized by multi-author collaboration and narrative agency for participants. Drawing upon the text of a pre-written scenario, as well as audio recordings from a play-through of that scenario, this essay catalogs significant points of departure between the two. This demonstrates the limits of authority between different types of authors (i.e. game designers, module writers, game masters, and players). It also reveals the points at which these roles bleed into one another, showing that professional and amateur authors are participating in much the same activity despite their apparent differences. Because TRPGs are predicated on creating texts in which amateur authors are engaged in the same work as their professional counterparts, and because texts are created with the expectation of input from lower-order authors, TRPGs represent a uniquely democratic form of convergence culture.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2017-11-29 14:57:05","","81","","","","","Off the Rails","","","","","University of Wyoming","Laramie, WY","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A. English Literature","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_language learning; _bleed; _fandom; _dnd; _cease&desist; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study of race in role-playing games has been neglected, and this is a tragedy, because these games offer a unique space where the concept of race, often a difficult and uncomfortable topic of conversation, is questioned, criticized, and reshaped by the players. Role-playing games are spaces of encounter between the players and a cast of imaginary others, and this requires a degree of empathy on the part of the players that makes role-playing games a space of ideological change, as players are forced to consider the world from viewpoints both familiar and alien. The theoretical framework within combines a phenomenological analysis of roleplaying games that allows non-gamers to understand the practice and importance of these games with critical race theorists such as bell hooks, Paul Gilroy, and Patricia Hill Collins that defines what race is and how it affects all of us on a day-to-day basis. This thesis is also based on interviews with geographically diverse set of gamers who demonstrate the highly personal nature of gaming, and how race takes on a multitude of meanings both within the fictional game settings and around the gaming table.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2017-11-29 15:00:40","","93","","","","","Roll to save vs. prejudice","","","","","Bowling Green State University","Bowling Green, OH","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A. Popular Culture","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781339342535","","","","_dnd; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","Role playing games; Race; Social sciences; Critical race studies; Critical race theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, digital role-play games often engage individual students at a computer, rather than creating rich social interactions among students. In order to design interactions that better support the core aspects of classroom role-play, we conducted interviews with teachers; we also interviewed role-play gamers to discover how traditional RPG techniques and technology can be used to enhance classroom role-play. In this paper we 1) explore the reasons instructors choose role-play for learning, such as giving students practice opportunities; 2) identify barriers to instructors using classroom role-play activities, such as time constraints and student discomfort; 3) report issues around integrating technology, such as the benefit of reducing cognitive load and the threat of distraction; and 4) highlight two areas where insights from role-playing games can inform the design of interactive learning systems for classroom role-play: by providing methods for emphasizing group success over individual achievement and by preserving the spirit of the experience.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-16 00:55:47","2017-12-11 14:38:17","241–251","","","","","","","CHI PLAY '17","","","","ACM","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","_TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that today, tabletop roleplaying game systems (RPGs) provide a superior hermeneutic for understanding how the fantasy genre operates in mass culture than does traditional genre theory. After providing a brief overview of the historical development of fantasy gaming out of wargaming and mass market fantasy literature in the 1970s, I show how RPGs formalized fantasy’s generic tropes into a modular system that enabled participants to produce fictions across and between genres. Through a reading of Poul Anderson’s use of the “multiverse” trope in his novel Three Hearts and Three Lions, the notion that reality consists of an infinite number of interconnected worlds, I argue RPGs completed a reorientation toward the fantastic begun by mass-market fantasy literature. Epistemological concerns, distinctions between fantastic genres, and individual authorship are de-emphasized in favor of established formal conventions, a shift which encourages a participatory model of consumption and ease of transmission across diverse media. I then use the HBO adaptation of George R. R. Martin’s Game of Thrones novels as an example of how this paradigmatic shift in the fantastic has moved beyond the niche markets of fantasy fiction and roleplaying games to manifest itself today as a hegemonic cultural norm.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-27 18:24:58","2018-01-05 17:31:10","273-301","","2-3","58","","Extrapolation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk (Atypon)","","Number: 2-3","","","","_authorship; _literature; _fandom; _worldbuilding; _anthropology; _review; _cinema; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018","American literature; role playing games; dramatic arts; 1900-1999; A Song of Ice and Fire series; Dungeons and Dragons; fantasy television; fictional world; Game of Thrones; genre conventions; imaginary place; Martin, George R.

Dragonlance and the Privatization of Genre","Extrapolation: A Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy","","0014-5483","10.3828/extr.2017.9","http://online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/doi/abs/10.3828/extr.2017.9","This essay examines the relationship between genre and franchise though a discussion of the Dragonlance series, a collection of pre-fabricated adventures for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons adapted into a series of novels. Because of the sheer number of these novels (approximately 200), the fiction set in the AD&D campaign setting known as Krynn far surpasses the scope of the original adventures in terms of narrative, character, geographical location, and historical situation. The sprawling nature of the novels, which implicitly seek to be an exhaustive account of Krynn and everything that happens there, would make Dragonlance one of the longest series in the history of generic fantasy. However, as I demonstrate, the development of the Dragonlance narrative takes place in the context of a franchise that turns away from the conventions of genre fantasy. The double origin of Dragonlance as both a setting for adventures in the AD&D game system and as a series of fantasy novels creates both the mechanistic feel of the early novels (those that were adapted directly from the pre-fabricated adventures and even from actual gaming sessions) as well as opportunities for the novels to eventually break from the conventions of generic fantasy, especially the latter’s particular concern with endings. My consideration of Dragonlance not only offers a consideration of the merely generic texts with which this special issue concerns itself, but also a means by which critics might consider franchises as objects.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 02:39:08","2018-01-05 17:33:29","129-152","","2-3","58","","Extrapolation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","online.liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk (Atypon)","","Number: 2-3 QID: Q114772253","","","https://doi.org/10.3828/extr.2017.9","_literature; _dnd; _copyright; _transmedia; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =biblio:DNDP2018; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A study was conducted into tabletop roleplaying games, using theoretical lenses from both information research and tabletop roleplaying game research, to observe the complexity of the relationship between the players and the official rulebooks. Method. A series of qualitative interviews was conducted with two groups of tabletop roleplaying gamers (a large, established group and a smaller, group of less experienced players) based on how they interact with the source material (the rulebooks). Analysis. Coded transcripts were analysed for trends and patterns of discourse, and the theoretical perspective of sense-making (from information research) was applied, to provide meaning to two common and related discursive frameworks from tabletop roleplaying research: the divide between ludologists (or role players); and how illicit knowledge is constructed through metagaming. Results. The study found the discursive frameworks surrounding metagaming and the role/roll player divide to be less a dividing factor and more a concept all players grasped with in the project of co-creating a fantastic reality: a sense-making process. Conclusions. From the point of information research, the study found that tabletop roleplaying games are an example of an information-rich leisure activity that allows and encourages its participants to ignore the official rules surrounding it. From the point of view of tabletop roleplaying game literature, the study casts doubt on the role/roll player dyad commonly adopted by theorists.","2017-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","1613","","","22(4)","","","Just rol[l/e] with it","","","","","Victoria U Wellington","Wellington, NZ","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc1.0/","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000418772300024","","","","_attitude change; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =citation-alert:WOS; _LEARNING","seeking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 Conference on Research Applications, Information and Library Studies (RAILS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

R. R. Tolkien and other fantasy authors. In this article, the author argues that, although Tolkien indeed provided pioneer game creators with specific content, historians have missed the important early influence on game history of children’s literature that advocates and illustrates role playing. Game scholars nod to such child’s play as make-believe and playground games, they often cite accounts of personal experiences in the childhood play of game designers, and they credit game books as an interactive link to fiction, but they have not included children’s texts in their histories. The author argues for placing children’s novels in such histories, particularly Zilpha Keatley Snyder’s The Egypt Game, which this article describes in full as a cultural forerunner in the history of role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 20:10:03","","208-228","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","Number: 2","","","","_major publication; _worldbuilding; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =blogged; =0.99; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =biblio:DNDP2018; =PM-lu; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since the late 20th century, Western society has undergone a “ludification,” as the influence of game-playing has grown ever more prevalent. At the same time, new theories of postmodernism have emphasized the importance of interactive, playful behavior. Core concepts of postmodernism are evident in pen-and-paper role-playing, such as Dungeons and Dragons. Exploring the interrelationships among narrative, gameplay, players and society, the author raises questions regarding authority, agency and responsibility, and discusses the social potential of RPGs in the 21st century.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2018-05-22 12:44:53","","279","","","","","The Postmodern Joy of Role-Playing Games","Studies in Gaming","","","","McFarland","Jefferson, NC","en","","","","","ProQuest","","Google-Books-ID: _JJMDwAAQBAJ QID: Q110930440","","","","_agency; _authorship; _ritual; _literature; _playfulness; _rpg theory; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","role playing games; fiction; genres; interactive fiction; play; postmodern culture; Games & Activities / Role Playing & Fantasy; Language Arts & Disciplines / General; Performing Arts / Storytelling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through the combined efforts of over 70 authors, artists, editors, and fans of RPG blogs - Volume 2 of Open Game Table has finally arrived! Inside you will find timeless interviews with Dave Arneson on the roots of roleplaying games, Robin D. Laws on RPG theory and game play, and Jonathan Roberts on his career as a master cartographer. The gaming community nominated nearly 400 articles for this volume, but the finalist were hand-picked by an independent panel of reviewers, and vetted by an experienced editorial board of RPG bloggers.Included in Volume 2 are over 60 blog articles that serve as the perfect complement to Volume 1: a chapter on playing RPGs with kids, a chapter on lies and mischief at the game table; and numerous articles aimed at gaming advice for campaign and adventure design, sandboxing, story pacing, play styles, and much much more. A true indy-press triumph. About Volume 1, WIRED.com's GeekDad blog says Volume 1 is ""... a treasure trove. A tome worth killing a few orcs for."" and ""The kind of brain stimulus role players need, diverse and quality content."" Bards & Sages Fantasy Review says ""Open Game Table, Volume 1 is the reference guide equivalent of a Deck of Many Things, ... you can draw from it again and again.""

He blew it. While other teenagers were being coolly rebellious, Mark—and twenty million other boys in the 1970s and ’80s—chose to spend his adolescence pretending to be a warrior, an evil priest, or a dwarf. He had discovered Dungeons & Dragons, and his life would never be the same. No longer would he have to settle for being Mark Barrowcliffe, an ordinary awkward teenager from working-class Coventry, England; he could be Alf the Elf, Foghat the Gnome, or Effilc Worrab, an elven warrior with the head of a mule. This is an hilarious memoir of an adolescence spent entirely in the world of fantasy.","2009","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","288","","","","","The Elfish Gene","","","","","Soho Press","New York, NY","en","","","","","Amazon","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the character trait rolls determines whether the avatar is Lawful (in the sense of rule-bound, consistent, and predictable) or Chaotic (in the sense of unruly, unpredictable, or inconsistent). A separate roll determines whether the avatar is Good, Evil, or Neutral. Thus, in the game, characters not only can be “lawful and good,” or “chaotic and evil,” but also “lawful and evil” or “chaotic and good.” From the usual jurisprudential standpoint, both the “lawful evil” and the “chaotic good” seem oxymoronic. We usually think that consistency and goodness go together. As Lon Fuller put it, “I shall have to rest on the assertion of a belief that may seem naïve, namely, that coherence and goodness have more affinity than coherence and evil.” From Kant’s universal principles of reason, to John Rawls’ operationalizing of Kant in his theory of the “original position,” which “generalizes and carries to a higher level of abstraction the familiar theory of the social contract,” to Ronald Dworkin’s “law as integrity” thesis that prefers the coherent interpretation to the incoherent - main-line legal theorists agree that good government ought to be coherent (lawful) and should not make ungeneralizable, un-rule-bound (chaotic) exceptions. In short, lawfulness is at least an aspect of good; unruliness is at least an aspect of evil. Political theorists have made similar points. Hannah Arendt and Lon Fuller point to Nazi Germany’s lawless use of retroactive legislation and its chaotic, opaque, and unpredictable lines of authority as essential means by which Hitler fostered fear and maintained personal control. On the other hand, the Dungeons and Dragons categories suggest that the association of lawfulness with goodness is not a logical necessity. Dolores Umbridge, Darth Vader, General Zod, and the Mayor of Pleasantville are among the classic “lawful evil” characters; Hans Solo, Captain Kirk, Robin Hood, and Mary Poppins are among the classic “chaotic good” characters.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2018-06-18 13:44:54","57-74","","","","","","Agape, Humility, and Chaotic Good","","","","","Cambridge University Press","Cambridge","en","","","","","Crossref","","DOI: 10.1017/9781316796931.006","","","","_philosophy; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Cochran, Robert F.

This study evaluated potential differences in character identification and interaction in a gaming context affording various character materialities: the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. Multimethod analysis of online survey data (N = 1,135) reveals that character identification and interaction dimensions were invariant across primary character-representation mode (figurine, physical image, digital image, written, and imagined); however, post-hoc analysis suggests that multimaterial assemblages and social factors are key in how character representations are linked to character relations.

Il vient de paraître. Sa concomitance avec la 3e édition du sondage du Thiase ainsi que le fait qu'il ait choisi de prendre précisément ce dernier pour exemple m'oblige à, non pas répondre, mais apporter simplement ma pierre à l'édifice. Sachez en tout cas que je suis personnellement ravi que le débat soit aussi clairement posé. ""Il est impossible de produire un sondage fiable sur la population rôliste ou GNiste"". Voilà commence l'article en question. Ma réaction est simple : oui c'est vrai, mais cela ne se limite pas aux sondages sur la population rôliste ou GNiste. Le sondage du Thiase : qu'est-ce donc ?

It takes a historical approach that is grounded in Foucauldian genealogy, arguing that the cultures of masculinity in Dungeons & Dragons can be discursively traced through published manuals and articles about the game. Drawing on fan conversations found in The Dragon, it compares the representations of masculinity found in these historic texts to the ways that masculinity is represented today in the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons. In staging this comparison, it shows how depictions of masculinity have progressed over the 40-year life span of Dungeons & Dragons, but also how they have stayed the same.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2018-10-11 16:47:05","129-147","","","","","","","Palgrave Games in Context","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-90581-5_8","","","","_dnd; _gender; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","Analog games; Masculinity; Media genealogy; Militarism; Tabletop games","Taylor, Nicholas; Voorhees, Gerald","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, one of the earliest fantasy role-playing games, which left a lasting impact on the industry, was the brainchild of Muhammad Abd al-Rahman (Phillip) Barker (1929-2012), a professor of South Asian Studies, an expert in Native American languages, and an American convert to Islam. Like Tolkien, Barker created an enormous fantasy world; however, unlike Tolkien, his world was redolent with Native American and South Asian cultural and religious influences. Through this world, he shared with his fans a nuanced understanding of non-Western societies, cultures, and beliefs – the facets of the human experience that truly constitute multiculturalism. While fictional religion in role-playing games has been feared and condemned, fictional religion (and occultism) plays a pivotal role in Barker’s work; an exploration of his approach towards fictional religion also sheds more light on the question of why fantasy role-playing games came across as competitors towards religion. Barker’s fantasy world brought people of diverse backgrounds together in a beautiful demonstration of how fantasy and science fiction can bring about intercultural and interreligious tolerance in an otherwise intolerant world. Given the centrality of games such as Dungeons & Dragons to American popular culture, an exploration of Barker’s legacy can also be seen in the light of the study of the history and contributions of Muslims in America. © 2017 Hartford Seminary.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-16 00:53:21","","387-418","","3","108","","","Muhammad Abd Al-Rahman (phillip) Barker","","","","","","","en","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","Number: 3 QID: Q107104790","","","","_dnd; _tolkien; _anthropology; _religion; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; =PM; _problematic; _SOCIOLOGY","Tékumel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This evolution is discussed by means of the “classic” Gamism-Narrativism-Simulationism model, and with reference to the history of RPGs in the English-speaking world. Even though they reached Poland 20 years after their birth, when simulationism and diceless storytelling were well-known abroad, Magia i Miecz did not import all playing styles at once. Instead, Polish RPGs went through the same developmental stages as in the USA: from gamism, across simulationism and narrativism, to diceless storytelling to dice-friendly storytelling and New Style  /  indie.","2016","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 20:10:06","","31","","9","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","Number: 9","","","","_poland; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These meaningful insights are essential for learners, allowing them to consider knowledge learned and apply relevant skills into different contexts and settings at a later date. Self-reflection allows students to develop their metacognition skills and work towards a practice that encourages continuous learning. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson (1974), utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/written/auditory/narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. By remixing D&D with Self-Reflection and formative assessment principles, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used as a basis to develop lifelong learning skills. This paper presents the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of the Remixed D&D: Reflection and Assessment system. The authors present a discussion of the next stage of the pilot trials and present their considerations of future work.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","872-875","","","","","","Remixing Dungeons and Dragons","","","","","Acad Conferences Ltd","SKEMA Business Sch","en","","","","","Web of Science","","WOS:000453557800106","","","","_gamification; _assessment; _dnd; _TTRPG; _self-reflection; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","Ciussi, M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","12th European Conference on Games Based Learning (ECGBL)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The survey included questions about demographics, TRPG experience, and four aspects of emotional distress (depression, anxiety, social isolation, and addictive behaviors) to test the hypothesis that having played TRPGs extensively or recently was negatively correlated with general emotional distress and each of the four aspects.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-04 16:31:51","2019-02-18 21:41:07","","60","","","","","","","","","","Alliant International University","Fresno","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Professional Psychology","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","2150207575","ProQuest","","ISBN: 978-0-438-70568-5 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses 10979240","","","","_therapy; _anxiety; Resiliency; _well-being; Clinical psychology; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), a table-top roleplaying games system developed by Gygax and Arneson, utilises a host of game mechanics such as, but not limited to: character creation, customisation, skills development, leveling over time, story-telling and a game-masters feedback. Many of the game mechanics in D&D, require the player to self-reflect on behalf of their character and continually assess how they wish their character to develop for future game sessions. Coupled with interactive feedback (visual/written/auditory/narrative-development) that is provided throughout each game session from a game master who leads the players through a pre-developed story, the basis of the mechanics provides some similarities to a facilitator leading learners through an assignment. In this paper, the authors present a playful example of how roleplaying games can be used to facilitate student self-reflection. A discussion of the design, method and mid-pilot feedback of n = 11 students undertaking the Dungeons & Dragons Self-Reflection Tool is presented alongside next stage pilot trials and considerations of future work.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","","101-109","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","_dnd; _student; _TTRPG; _self-reflection; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","Gentile, Manuel; Allegra, Mario; Söbke, Heinrich","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modern examples from a wide range of media and genres-including Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials and the novels of Helen Oyeyemi, the Rocky Horror Picture Show and Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, and the role-playing games Dungeons and Dragons and Warhammer 40K-are brought alongside episodes from ancient myth, important moments from history, and more.  All together, these multifaceted studies add to our understanding of how science fiction and fantasy form important areas of classical reception, not only transmitting but also transmuting images of antiquity. The volume concludes with an inspiring personal reflection from the New York Times-bestselling author of speculative fiction, Catherynne M. Valente, offering her perspective on the limitless potential of the classical world to resonate with experience today.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2019-03-06 14:25:32","149-171","","","","xii, 233 pp.","","","Bloomsbury Studies in Classical Reception","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","London","en","","","","","ProQuest","","","","","","_literature; _dnd; _genre; _monster; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","role playing games; fiction; genres; Dungeons and Dragons; interactive fiction; classical tradition; fantasy fiction; gods; monsters; Ancient Roman culture; board game; divine authority; emperor; science fiction; the future; war; Warhammer 40,000","Rogers, Brett M; Stevens, Benjamin Eldon; Valente, Catherynne M","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The students decided that they would like to adapt Dungeons and Dragons for their classroom project, which presented a unique opportunity to integrate the content and skill objectives in math, social studies, and writing into the design and play of the game. Students decided which elements of the game to adapt, what steps to take to achieve these goals, and how to play their game. The teacher provided materials, asked questions, and assessed the students’ progress to ensure that these cross-curricula goals were achieved.

Pen-and-paper roleplaying games are a complex form of games, with three distinct frames which are ludological, social, and diegetic (also called narrative). The frames are different aspects of the game as well as the base of different motivations for players, who value the frames in a varied degree. The goal of this thesis is to examine if in-game choices based on the diegetic frame in contrast to the ludological frame are correlated with the player/character connection. The method used for data collection is distribution of a quantitative questionnaire on the internet, spread to Swedish roleplayers through social media and associations tied to SVEROK. With their answers, the analysis identifies correlations between the player/character connection and the three frames of pen-and-paper roleplaying games, as well as other correlations noted in the data analysis. The literature revolves around the two core concepts; the player/character connection and the three frames of roleplaying games. The result shows that diegetic choices in contrast to ludological are weakly correlated with the player/character connection.","2014","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2019-04-16 16:27:48","","37","","","","","","","","","","Uppsala Universitet","Uppsala","en","","Degree Project in Game Design","","","","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a case study where TFRPGs were used to generate and collect data for maps of belief environments using fiction co-created by multiple small groups of online tabletop gamers. The affordances of TFRPGs allowed us to collect repeatable, targeted data in online field conditions. These data not only included terms that allowed us to build our maps, but also to explore nuanced ethical problems from a situated, collaborative perspective.","2019-04-10","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 14:55:00","2019-04-24 13:07:11","","","arXiv:1904.05216","","","","Dungeons for Science","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","Number: arXiv:1904.05216 arXiv: 1904.05216","","","","_collaborative; _preprint; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY; _MEDIA; _non peer-reviewed","Computer Science - Computers and Society; Computer Science - Social and Information Networks; H.5.1; H.5.3; I.3.0; J.4; K.4.3; K.8.0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We offer examples of middle school students building science fiction explanations to justify their decisions during a week-long role-playing game (RPG) design workshop. Findings show how worldbuilding---that is, defining the game's setting, history, and characters---supported students in formulating relevant science questions, integrating various science ideas into complex mechanistic explanations, and articulating and critiquing ideas. They also show the challenges students faced in balancing fiction and science to create credible game worlds; and how differences in participation affected collaborators' ultimate abilities to explain.

Several studies have been developed in order to understand these phenomena and find solutions to these problems. This paper begins with a brief contextualization of the current Brazilian situation and some challenges regarding relationships in Brazilian high schools.

Typically, however, these games are specifically designed to focus upon an exact facet of learning. Examples include the replication or simulation of certain scenarios, establishing focus upon an affective objective, or presenting content in an alternative manner. Rather than utilize a game for a purpose described above, this article explores two unique possibilities. First, that by using an established role-playing game (RPG) as a learning activity, it is possible to reinforce key social learning constructs desired in educational settings that can regularly only be taught in non-optimal settings. Second, the game itself can serve as a platform for the new type of learning desired in the future of education. In the discussion, the author theorizes if these two possibilities are evident, the future of education may be at a crossroads where it is necessary to reconsider our educational objectives.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:14:24","","18-25","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Number: 1","","","","_dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _benefits of rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fandom being examined here is devoted to the Cthulhu Mythos, a series of short interwoven sci-fi horror stories about monstrous alien gods and their dealings with human beings. Born of the pen of pulp author H.P. Lovecraft during the 1920s, this unique brand of ""cosmic horror"" survived its author's death by continually mutating to this day, attracting a wide ranging group of individuals who have ""consecrated themselves"" to Lovecraft's literary legacy and ""long for the return of the monster gods"" he dreamed up.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:19:51","","512-530","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","Number: 3","","","","_fandom; _lovecraft; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also the prototype of Dungeons and Dragons, the first published role playing game. Unlike other fantasy worlds, such as J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth, Blackmoor is a living world that is being explored to this day. Secrets of Blackmoor investigates the origins of the role playing game, through candid interviews, archival footage, and newly discovered artifacts. In 1964, David Wesely becomes a founding member of a club that includes history buffs, model makers, and miniature collectors. Hiding within the group, however, are a bunch of college students who are interested in war gaming. Within a year, the gamers meet a high school kid named Dave Arneson who is playing war games with his friends in his parents' basement. These gamers have no idea that they will change the face of this hobby forever. Their only concern for now, is how to simulate the reality of war, and above all, they just want to have fun. Their voracious hunt for new rules and knowledge leads them to the University of Minnesota Library where they discover an old manuscript, Strategos; the American Game of War. Within the dense pages are a few sentences that inspire them. The influence of Strategos changes how they play their war games. But are they really following these old rules, or have they stumbled onto something truly unique by misinterpreting what it says? Should a game be constrained by rules, like Monopoly, or should there be no boundaries at all, like a game of make believe? One thing is very clear--something magical was going on in the Twin Cities.","2019-05-08","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-03 17:28:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","Fellowship of the Thing","","","","Documentary","","","","","Directors: _:n17052","","","","_dnd; _arneson; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _proto-history of rpg; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, this study sought to determine what role or roles educators should play in developing the gaming culture of teenage students. In order to answer these questions, seven people who played TRPGs as teenagers were interviewed about their past and current TRPG interests, past and current leisure reading habits, and the effects that playing TRPGs had on their literacy skills. This study revealed that all participants felt that playing TRPGs improved at least one literacy skill and that greater depth and breadth of TRPG experience helped some participants to surmount real or perceived difficulties with reading or speaking; TRPGs also helped participants improve listening skills . In most cases, playing TRPGs also led to a greater quantity of leisure reading. However, TRPGs did not appear to influence which genres participants read; some who previously read fantasy appreciated the connections they saw in TRPGs; yet others did not see TRPGs relating to their reading interests. While some participants saw their schooling and TRPG interests overlap, none saw a need for educators to take an active role in encouraging TRPG gaming among students.","2017-01-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","Dungeons and Dragons and literacy","","","","","University of Northern Iowa","","en","","Master of Arts.

Composé de plusieurs sous-projets, nous nous intéressons ici à EdUTeam Wargames. Notre communication, issue d’un travail encore très exploratoire, puisque les premiers travaux sur ce type de jeux datent de juillet 2019, souhaite répondre à la problématique suivante : comment les wargames peuvent-ils contribuer à l’apprentissage expérientiel du management ? Pour se faire, nous rendons compte de la mise en place systématique de wargames au sein de chaque séance d’un cours d’introduction au management en 2ème année de Licence à l’IAE Gustave Eiffel (Université de Paris-Est Créteil, UPEC) afin de proposer aux étudiant·e·s des situations managériales réalistes, maîtrisées et à la complexité croissante. Les résultats les plus importants de cette implémentation originale concernent l’articulation réussie entre les situations managériales réalistes générées par les scénarios des jeux, le corpus de connaissances théoriques de base indispensable à tout futur manager et un référentiel de compétences créé spécifiquement sur la base du référentiel de la fiche répertoire national des certifications professionnelles (RNCP) du diplôme de Licence en Gestion. Pour autant, nous avons rencontré plusieurs obstacles qu’il conviendra d’étudier plus en profondeur : la dimension éthique des wargames, l’évaluation des compétences, la barrière de la langue puisque la grande majorité des jeux est en langue anglaise et la complexité des règles.","2019-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2020-01-04 04:45:21","","","","","","","Le projet EdUTeam","","","","","","Toulouse, France","","","","","","HAL Archives Ouvertes","","","","","","_wargame; _gamification; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Twelve college students participated in six approximately 4-hour gaming sessions using a customized game system based on Dungeons & Dragons™ (D&D, 1974, 4th ed.). The games contained embedded social/moral dilemmas (e.g., whether to torture a prisoner for information) that participants encountered and had to work through as a group. Significant growth in moral development, as measured with the Defining Issues Test and the Self-Understanding Interview was demonstrated in the gaming groups, but was not replicated in two control groups, who did not participate in the gaming sessions. This suggests that imaginative role-play gaming structures can function as an engaging, interactive “moral training ground,” a medium that promotes moral development, and highlights the difference between antisocial and prosocial violence.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2020-01-08 21:25:53","99-129","","1","60","","Journal of Humanistic Psychology","Imaginative Role-Playing as a Medium for Moral Development","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Number: 1 QID: Q106850239","","","https://doi.org/10.1177/0022167816686263","_pretend play; _attitude change; _empathy; _dnd; _moral play; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","aggression; violent video games; skills; behavior; self; imaginative role-playing games; moral development; moral reasoning; adolescents; comprehension; fantasy; judgment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To accomplish that, the usage of a Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) was proposed, in conjunction with the user's input (positive or negative) during generations, to create characters focused on having traits that are catered to each individual's taste. The generated traits are ""Race"", ""Class"", ""Size"", ""Visual Trait"", ""Personality"" and ""Quirk"". The fitness calculation for each individual was made using trait tables with weights previously defined by the programmer, and posteriorly by the user's evaluation of the characters during execution. The project was made using the Unity game engine with C# language, to take advantage of the tool's easy interface creation. It was produced as a phone application, for ease of distribution and general use. The application was tested with a variety of users, and the results, presented in the form of graphs, indicate that the rejection rate was almost null, with the great majority of users recognizing the gradual improvement of suggestions between generations, and evaluating positively the characters generated by the algorithm.","2019-10","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-05 14:55:18","","39-46","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Rio de Janeiro","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2159-6654","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/sbgames.2019.00016","_procedural storytelling; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _character; _ai ml llm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 18th Brazilian Symposium on Computer Games and Digital Entertainment (SBGames)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Il est réalisé sur un mandat de la Bibliothèque des Jeunes (BJ) de La Chaux-de-Fonds, en association avec la Bibliothèque de la Ville de La Chaux-de-Fonds (BV). Le mandat est lié à la présence d’un fonds de livres de jeu de rôle dans les collections de la BV depuis 2012. Ce fonds n’est pas valorisé au sein des collections et peine à trouver son public. Le mandat vise à explorer la vocation, les possibilités et les contraintes d’une offre de jeu de rôle en bibliothèque de lecture publique. Il s’agit plus spécifiquement, en lien avec le mandat : • De proposer une offre de jeu de rôle cohérente avec les besoins et les contraintes exprimés par la BJ : cette offre pourra s’orienter vers un fonds comme vers des activités de jeu de rôle dans le cadre de la BJ. • De proposer des recommandations pour la valorisation et la médiation du fonds de livres de jeu de rôle de la BV. Pour ce faire, un état de l’art du jeu de rôle en bibliothèque est effectué : la place du jeu en bibliothèque, mais également le jeu de rôle en lui-même sont analysés et expliqués, grâce à une revue de la littérature et des recherches complémentaires sur différents médias et au travers d’entretiens. L’état de l’art propose un volet pratique avec la réalisation de deux enquêtes : • L’une visant à identifier les profils et les moeurs des pratiquants de jeu de rôle. Les résultats sont ensuite analysés pour établir les caractéristiques de ce public ciblé par l’offre de la BV. • L’autre visant à recueillir les retours d’expériences de bibliothèques publiques ayant mis en place une offre de jeu de rôle. Cet examen de réalisations concrètes permet d’identifier des points clés de l’élaboration d’une telle offre. Finalement, d’après les conclusions de l’état de l’art et de l’état des lieux, je proposerai des recommandations concrètes qui devront ensuite permettre aux deux bibliothèques de La Chaux-de-Fonds d’orienter leur offre liée au jeu de rôle. Il s’agira de fournir des pistes de réflexion pour orienter le fonds de la BV vers de nouveaux publics, tel que les jeunes et les familles. Ainsi le fonds pourra s’ouvrir aux publics de la BJ, et cette dernière pourra avoir un outil pour intégrer la pratique du jeu de rôle dans son activité. Je proposerai également des recommandations en lien avec la médiation du fonds, de même que l’organisation d’activités de jeu de rôle dans les deux bibliothèques pour les différents publics et selon différentes modalités.

Though the game’s resurgence has been widely discussed in non-academic outlets, it has been neglected in academic literature. While there are many factors motivating renewed and engaged play of D&D, in this paper we draw on our 2019 study of contemporary D&D players to present key contextual factors of the game’s resurgence. Through discussion of our results, we argue that the influence of representations and trends in popular media, reduction of associated stigma, and impact of convergence culture (Jenkins, 2006) on increased game access, have led to the resurgence of D&D according to our participants and shed light on some key reasons for its success in recent years.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

EC has been found to be related to various constructs across different fields of psychology during the past 30 years, but a comprehensive examination of previous research is still lacking. The goal of this review is to explore the reliability of use of the Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI) across studies, to test gender differences and to compare levels of EC in different countries. Thirty-five empirical studies focused on EC were retrieved and the coefficients required for the meta-analysis extracted. The meta-analysis revealed that women showed significantly higher EC than men (total N = 3,555). The same gender differences were also found when testing scores from three ECI subscales, i.e. emotional novelty, emotional preparedness and emotional effectiveness/authenticity. When comparing EC in 10 different countries (total N = 4,375), several cross-cultural differences were revealed. The Chinese sample showed a significantly lower average ECI total score than all the other countries. Based on the integration of results, the avenues for future research on EC and the breadth of influence of the concept of EC across different fields of psychology are discussed.","2020-04-30","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-05 14:33:04","2020-05-21 12:53:11","151-160","","2","32","","","Emotional Creativity","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Number: 0 Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10400419.2020.1751541","","","","_creativity; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, learning means much more than acquiring specific content in academic subjects. Assuming that the training in the school should be based on the autonomy and flexibility of the curriculum, and that meaningful learning requires several literacies [1], multiple theoretical and practical skills, promotion of scientific knowledge, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, creativity and collaborative work and the 21st century skills are feasible through game-based learning [2] or playful literacy [3]. So, this article reports on a role-play game experience aimed at these competencies and specially to interpersonal relationships and self-concept. The experience was presented, following a request for a psychoeducational intervention in a school group with complaints of behavior, challenge to authority, breach of norms and lack of cordial conduct, attitudes of conflict, with great heterogeneity of ages, socio-cultural provenance and suspicious situations of (pre) bullying among students. The experience consisted on the interpretation of characters in a role-play table-top game (RPG) inspired by Dungeons and Dragons (D&D or DnD) [4]. The characters move themselves in a fantasy adventure while actively constructing a story, in an open world of possibilities where each participant decides within the limits of the reasonability allowed by the others and the contexts presented by the narrator, or D-Master (DM). The narrator organizes the game, creates the details describing to the players what they see and hear, presents the challenges, maintaining a realistic continuity of events while controlling the development of the adventure, except in the actions of the characters. Everyone play and take own decisions to solve the problems faced and described by the DM. The decisions are discussed and a consensus must arise or is determined by the narrator's orientations in accordance with the fate and consequences of rolling the dice. Playing the game suppose immersion in the scenarios presented, acceptance of the challenge and a state of flow or focus shifted from the real world to the game world, social interaction and affect generated. So, by participating in the game, the 24 students of the 7th grade participating were encouraged to put into practice values and competencies identified to be essential to develop themselves as individuals and members of a group. After a period of 5 sessions, the individual experiences were assessed in terms of flow, self-competence, affection towards the others using de Game User Questionnaire [5]. All the participants expressed pleasure in participating and availability to continue the experience, noting their improved ability to regulate the mood and social behaviour. They also revealed interest in deepening different themes, that means, availability to learn. The students, teachers as well as the observers concluded that the approach was pertinent and should go on within the school context to promote competencies.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","10307-10314","","","","","","","","","","","Iated-Int Assoc Technology Education & Development","Valenica","en","","","","","Web of Science","","ISSN: 2340-1117 WOS:000553304904148","","","","_immersion; _roleplayification; _empathy; _group dynamics; _dnd; _self-efficacy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _yo1-12; _LEARNING; _EMOTIONS; _GAMEPLAY","","Chova, L.

These fears lack a scientific basis, as role-playing games may be useful in education. Educational trends such as gamification are helping to change this perspective, incorporating elements of RPGs in applications like learning management systems (LMS), e.g., Classcraft. Given the increased research interest in this topic, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) report on the state-of-the-art related to RPGs in an Ibero-American education research context. In the study, a comprehensive search is carried out for the most relevant research papers indexed in Latindex, founded through the virtual repository Dialnet for papers between 2010 and 2019 in the field of education. The search chain was &lsquo;role-playing games&rsquo;, erasing those topics not related.

En ce sens, elle est centrale aux réflexions du designer de jeu dont le travail doit, au mieux, aider le joueur à atteindre l’expérience visée par le jeu. Malheureusement, à l’heure actuelle, aucune approche connue de design ne permet au designer d’agir sur cette expérience de manière volontaire et concrète. En nous intéressant à la philosophie de l’action, qui nous permet de ramener l’expérience à l’action puis au raisonnement, nous sommes partis à la recherche d’une approche qui nous permettrait d’influencer les désirs, les connaissances et les croyances du joueur, dans le but d’agir directement sur son raisonnement.  En suivant la piste du design persuasif déjà tracée par d’autres auteurs en design, nous avons opté pour une approche basée sur le Traité de l’argumentation. Cette approche a été bâtie sur la traduction des principaux concepts de l’argumentation. Ensuite, en nous intéressant aux écrits en recherche par le design, nous avons mis ladite approche à l’épreuve à travers la création d’un jeu de rôle de table et des tests utilisateur. Le design et les tests utilisateur nous ont permis de recueillir — à travers un journal de bord, l’observation directe des participants, et des groupes de discussion — des données pour affiner le modèle théorique de l’approche.  L’expérimentation a révélé qu’un design persuasif permettrait bel et bien d’influencer les désirs, les connaissances et les croyances des joueurs, mais que la discussion dépasse le lien causal de la mécanique de jeu vers l’expérience visée. En effet, le designer pourra user de plusieurs outils rhétoriques à travers les attributs du jeu pour mener le joueur vers son épanouissement. Malgré tout, ces outils ne sont que des tremplins utilisés pour amener le joueur à travers plusieurs étapes et comportements qu’il posera de lui-même.  Cette thèse discutera spécifiquement du design persuasif appliqué à la conception d’un jeu de rôle, et pourra, à l’avenir, grandir dans un programme de recherche qui viserait le design persuasif au sens large.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 16:01:17","2020-09-21 02:03:21","","392","","","","","Design persuasif de jeu de rôle de table","","","","","Université de Montréal","Montréal","fr","","Doctorat en design de jeu","","","papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca","","Accepted: 2019-11-18T19:08:19Z","","","","_attitude change; _information literacy; _group dynamics; _negotiation; _conversation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Il s'agit du jeu de rôle Cuba 1962, simulant la crise de Cuba pendant la guerre froide, opposant des acteurs du conflit, interprétés par les élèves. En tant qu'élèves-acteurs, ils ont dû prendre des décisions pour résoudre la crise de Cuba, notamment pendant les négociations, et ainsi comprendre que les hommes du passé étaient des acteurs. Ces décisions déterminaient le futur des personnages qu'ils interprétaient. Ainsi, ils ont pu comprendre que ces hommes du passé avaient un futur incertain. Ce jeu a pu simuler une histoire différente et soulever un large champ des possibles, qui auraient pu advenir en octobre 1962. En comparant après le jeu, leur résultat avec la réalité historique, les élèves ont pu constater l'incertitude de cet événement du passé, dépendant de l'action des hommes.","2015","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2020-09-21 02:12:26","","115","","","","","","","","","","ESPE Nantes - École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation","Nantes","fr","","Master","","","hal-univ-tlse3.archives-ouvertes.fr","","","","","","_rttp; _history; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a wealth of texts available suitable for exploration. The example ofThe Adventure Zonein particular presents a strong argument that the medium possesses its own singular strengths for storytelling.The Adventure Zoneis a fictional, audio-only, serialised podcast in which a narrative of both considerable length and depth is constructed through the playing of tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons. It is hosted by the McElroy brothers, Griffin, Justin, and Travis, along with their father, Clint.The Adventure Zonedemonstrates the unique qualities and noteworthy potential the podcast medium possesses. The McElroy family collaborates utilising comedy improv practices, which are strengthened by the game's mechanics and rules. The line between characters and players - along with the line between textual and metatextual, canonical and non-canonical, diegetic and non-diegetic data - is significantly blurred through instances such as self-reflexivity and popular culture references. The fourth wall is inapplicable toThe Adventure Zone. It is necessary to re-imagine it instead as a permeable curtain separating the players from the characters. The listeners are provided with a clear view of not only the story ofThe Adventure Zone, but the construction of its creation. There are few mediums in which the audience can so effectively and candidly witness the storytelling process. Comparisons drawn from the original text -The Adventure Zonepodcast - to its ongoing adaptations -The Adventure Zonegraphic novels - illustrates this fact further.

The case in question focuses on Riotminds, a Swedish RPG publishing company that in 2010, in one broad stroke, transformed and converged all their analogue printed products into a single, online subscription service. Drawing on a general theoretical framework of materiality and (cultural) practice, the purpose of this article is to investigate the effects of digitization by asking: What does this particular instance of technological transformation and expressions of resistance reveal about materiality and the ongoing tensions between what constitutes meaningful digital and analogue immersive experiences? The results contribute to a critical, materialist perspective on digitization that encompasses both Digital’s virtues and challenges in terms of the digital transformation of physical practices and physical space. In other words, forwarding an understanding of digitalization as an intricate aesthetic shift, where identified analog sensibilities are converted into digital sensibilities, and its consequences for creating meaningful gaming experiences on behalf of the user (or player).","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 16:59:15","2021-01-14 15:01:46","1-19","","3","27","","Convergence","Pen, paper, dice…screen?","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd QID: Q114784962","","","","_layout; _archive; _miniature; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _LIBRARY; _DESIGN; _MEDIA; _sweden","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"NDYYEW8B","thesis","2020","Augé, Claire","Jeu de rôle et ""cercles de personnage"" : l'immersion fictionnelle pour engager dans la lecture de l’œuvre racinienne en lycée général aujourd'hui","","","","","https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03102700","« Le jeu est le refoulé des études littéraires », écrit Michel Picard en 1986. A la suite de cette remarque, nous souhaitons envisager, dans une démarche didactique, l’articulation du jeu et de la lecture d’une œuvre patrimoniale complexe en cours de français. Il s’agit de (ré)concilier la sphère ludologique et la sphère didactique de la littérature en proposant un dispositif de lecture qui permette à tous les lecteurs, et même les plus faibles, de lycée général, de lire une tragédie racinienne. Nous défendons la thèse que le jeu de rôle explicite, au sein de la classe, le jeu de la lecture, à la fois intime et social, faisant alors apparaître, autour d’un texte scolaire, obligatoire et difficile, un véritable plaisir de la lecture partagé entre pairs. Il nous semble voir là une piste, dans le prolongement de la recherche didactique et des travaux sur le sujet-lecteur, pour motiver la lecture d’œuvres patrimoniales. Tout d’abord, nous définissons l’immersion fictionnelle, source de plaisir commune à la lecture et au jeu de rôle. Puis, nous avons observé comment la question de la motivation a été envisagée au sein de la didactique de la littérature pour engager les élèves tout en con-sidérant l’œuvre patrimoniale comme un objet d’enseignement. Enfin, nous avons pensé précisé-ment le jeu de rôle comme point de rencontre entre la ludologie et les études littéraires. Notre attention s’est portée sur la lecture des tragédies raciniennes en classe, œuvres au statut en partie éminemment scolaire qui sont difficiles et éloignées des jeunes lycéens. Ensuite, nous présentons un dispositif de lecture qui modifie en profondeur le cheminement de la lecture, associant la tragédie classique à une partie de jeu de rôle : la lecture devient collaborative entre pairs,réunis en « cercles de personnage ».Nos travaux présentent les résultats d’une recherche exploratoire menée dans quatre classes de lycée général. Nous formulons l’hypothèse qu’un tel dispositif ludique permet non seulement de motiver la lecture auprès de tous les lycéens, même les non-lecteurs, mais leur donne aussi la possibilité de s’approprier personnellement le texte au sein de la collectivité de la classe tout en développant des compétences.","2020-11-20","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-01-16 03:29:58","","621","","","","","Jeu de rôle et ""cercles de personnage""","","","","","Université Grenoble Alpes","Grenoble","fr","","Ph.D. Littérature française et didactique de la littérature","","","tel.archives-ouvertes.fr","","","","","","_immersion; _literature; _reading; _motivation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No longer limited to simply reading books or watching movies, gamers came together to collaboratively and interactively build and explore new realms. Based on four years of interviews and game recordings from locations spanning the United States, this book offers a journey that explores how role-playing games use a combination of free-form imagination and tightly constrained rules to experience those realms. By developing our understanding of the fantastic worlds of role-playing games, this book also offers insight into how humans come together and collaboratively imagine the world around us.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","","","","","","","Palgrave Games In Context","","","","Palgrave Macmillan","Basingstoke","en","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 1140133985","","","","_immersion; _worldbuilding; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cette expression, utilisée jusque dans les jeux de rôle contemporains, pose la question de la possibilité d’analyser le contenu de ces produits à l’aune de travaux scientifiques portant sur les mythes et les mythologies. Le présent article propose d’étudier le « mythe de Cthulhu » sous l’angle des théories de la réception des mythes proposées par Hans Blumenberg, afin de comprendre la diffusion des ressources auxquelles il renvoie. L’usage de ces références contribue à la mise en scène de l’horreur et rend ainsi possible ses appropriations ludiques en instaurant une distance avec le contenu des représentations. En effet, les mécanismes des jeux, tout comme les représentations de l’horreur, donnent une forme concrète à l’indicible et réduisent alors sa part suggestive.","2017-12-31","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-30 01:08:33","2021-02-16 15:20:31","110-119","","58","","","","","","","","","","","fr","Les contenus de la Revue des sciences sociales sont mis à disposition selon les termes de la Licence Creative Commons Attribution - Pas d’Utilisation Commerciale - Partage dans les Mêmes Conditions 4.0 International.","","","","journals.openedition.org","","ISBN: 9782868209702 Number: 58 Publisher: Presses universitaires de Strasbourg QID: Q114785041","","","","_literature; _lovecraft; _fear; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Attending to players’ testimonies of personal renewal and political resistance, we find that D&D is an arena for what I theorize as edification: an enrichment of one’s subjectivity that is experienced as beneficial, transformational, or even salvific (that is, as effecting rescue or liberation from ruinous ways of life), even as it proves culturally contested and socially divisive.","2021-02-26","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-18 01:08:38","2021-03-20 02:34:33","316-331","","4","22","","Political Theology","Blessed Are the Legend-Makers","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/1462317X.2021.1890933 QID: Q114731361","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/1462317x.2021.1890933","_creativity; _therapy; _attitude change; _dnd; _moral play; _religion; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _transformative; _belonging; =rabbit; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","game studies; fiction; storytelling; ethical formation; imagination; racialization; resistance; subculture; subjectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are factors considered to promote mental health recovery. This study investigates whatthemes emerge from the stories of role-playing game players in recovery from mental health difficulty and how their stories reflect existing models of mental health recovery.Method: This study utilised narrative inquiry to understand the experiences of Dungeons and Dragon players in recovery from mental health difficulties. Thirteen Dungeons & Dragonsplayers (M = 33.31; SD = 10.05) were interviewed about their experience with the game and recovery. Analysis of narratives was conducted inductively and deductively.Result: Participants discussed a number of factors that linked Dungeons & Dragons to their mental health wellbeing. These included a) experiencing through characters, b) skill building, c) finding space from mental health symptoms, d) safely engaging with mental health difficulties, and e) building relationships. All five stages of the Psychological Recovery Model (Andresen, Oades & Caputi, 2003) were present, and participants engaged with Dungeons & Dragons in a manner reflective of their mental health recovery process. Conclusion The current study expands on research that conceptualizes recovery asa multidimensional process and highlights new elements that have implications for consumers and theoretical frameworks.KEY POINTSWhat is already known about this topic:(1) Mental health difficulties can severely impact a person’s quality of life and disrupt their internal narrative.(2) Mental health difficulties can severely impact a person’s quality of life and disrupt their internal narrative.(3) Community based activities can foster a sense of growth, self-mastery and agency that may ultimately lead to identity reconstruction and a sense of personal recovery.(4) Role-playing games have been identified as potentially helpful in assisting people with mental health difficulties restore a sense of agency and positive identity.What this topic adds:(1) Australian Dungeon and Dragon (D&D) players with a history of mental health difficulties were interviewed in regards to their experiences of role-playing and their mental health recovery.(2) Participants reported D&D assisted with building relationships with other players, experiencing emotions through their character, developing adaptive skills, engaging with difficult mental health topics and experiencing a safe space from mental health difficulties.(3) All five stages of the Psychological Recovery Model were present, and participants engaged with D&D in a manner reflective of their mental health recovery process.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-03-29 20:40:04","256-267","","3","56","","","Defeating Dragons and Demons","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00050067.2021.1890983 QID: Q114269871","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/00050067.2021.1890983","_major publication; _mental disorder; _therapy; _dnd; _anxiety; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","mental health; dungeons and dragons; positive gaming; Recovery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data were collected from interviews with six individuals who regularly engage in tabletop role-playing games. The study asked open ended questions regarding participants' experiences with the role-playing community, thematic and emotional content experienced within the fantasy setting, and benefits participants felt they'd gained from role-playing games and access to that community. The key findings of this study were that community access and feelings of belonging were an important part of the role-playing experience, that participants reported the context of fantasy play decreased their social anxiety which allowed them to interact with their own emotional content meaningful ways, and that role experimentation through their characters led to improved social skills in all participants.","2014","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","50","","","","","","","","","","Smith College","Northampton, MA","en","","Masters Thesis of Social Work","","","Zotero","","","","","","_therapy; _anxiety; _TTRPG; _benefits of rpg; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A tabletop role-playing game presupposes that its participants constantly articulate statements which shift the current configuration of in-game elements and also play the role of being artistic descriptions of said shifts. The alternation and interplay of performative and descriptive statements, their convolution and also the fact that, in tabletop RPGs, unlike in the majority of the rest of the games known to humanity, the same words from natural languages are used both in order to produce a shift in abstract, symbolic structure of a game, and to artistically describe said shift, all lead to the situation where participants cannot tell a proper symbolic system of a given game from other symbolic systems which this game refers to. In this article, we propose an analytical model of a tabletop RPG which would make it possible to draw stricter borderlines between a given RPG’s fictional world and its inner symbolic structure. Furthermore, it would allow us to formulate a clearer question regarding the structures of power produced while playing an RPG, and what exactly players gain control over while playing it. Moreover, this model would enable us to explore in detail the processes of the individual and collective interpretation of events in a tabletop RPG, and classify facts within said interpretation in relation to whether they are held to be objectively or subjectively true.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 03:31:08","2021-04-12 13:59:58","","","3","32","","","","","","","","","","ru","","","","","scite.ai","","","","","","_group dynamics; _conflict; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Interactive Dilemma is the inevitable conflict between author's determinism and interactor's freedom. There are some approaches that try to tackle it, using strategies and heuristic rules that can combine on the fly the previously designed author material with the run-time decisions of the interactor. Interactive Narrative is a relatively new field and it is difficult to find formal studies that shows how to create this kind of art. Our proposal is based on the theoretical study of tabletop Role-Playing Games and it involves the practical implementation of those ideas for managing the interaction in a simple text adventure game. Game Masters are the best models we have found in real life for designing and directing interactive stories. In this paper we transfer their player modeling, their rules for interaction management and their improvising algorithms from the real world to a new Interactive Storytelling system.","2004","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:11:01","2021-04-12 14:06:00","48-54)","","","3105","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Frauenhofer IRB Verlag","Stuttgart, Germany","en","","","","","scite.ai","","QID: Q107608256","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-27797-2_7","_plot structure; _procedural storytelling; _GMing; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; =PM; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _ai ml llm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We conducted semi-directed interviews with nine participants who identified themselves as having used such practices to overcome difficult and challenging life experiences. We look at how participants interpreted their play experiences, described by some as “therapeutic.” Through TTRPGs, players were able to explore and better understand aspects of themselves, explore new interactions, and “test” new ways of expressing themselves. Additionally, participants were able to develop their interpersonal skills by participating in such practices, namely because of the roleplaying element. Participants stated that these practices and their therapeutic qualities also had positive effects on their lives outside of the game, helping them to enter and engage in various social situations that they previously felt excluded from, or hesitant to participate in. We argue that social interventions could invest in these types of cultural practices, embedded in popular culture, to encourage and facilitate participation of adolescents and adults in mental health services.&#x0D;","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 02:07:43","2021-04-12 14:06:53","17-21","","1","6","","","Pop culture and social insertion","","","","","","","en","","","","","scite.ai","","QID: Q114772198","","","","_therapy; _canada; _minority; _yo13-19; _oral communication; _well-being; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _belonging; _self-advocacy; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on the role of spatiality and materiality in nondigital contexts, this study broadens how literacies research engages with sociocultural analysis of primarily analog settings. Building on experiences in playing the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, the author analyzed how literacies shape the collaborative storytelling and interpretation of complex rules mechanics required for play. The author drew on 26 months of collected ethnographic data, including participant observation of hundreds of hours of tabletop role-playing game sessions, interviews, and textual analysis. Describing how gaming literacy practices are enacted, the findings from this study identify three different spaces in which analog literacies often emerge: in-game literacies, at-the-table literacies, and beyond-the-table literacies. Exploring how participants read, produce, and communicate in ways that move across these domains, the author emphasizes the roles of temporality and spatiality in understanding contemporary literacies. Further, as Dungeons & Dragons is mediated by myriad books and physical objects, such as dice, sheets of paper, and small figurines, the role of materiality in analog literacies differs substantially from digital contexts. At the same time, exploring the cultural practices and talk that shaped play, the author emphasizes that analog gaming remains connected to the digital affordances of online texts, transmedia production, and tools for communication. By considering how seemingly archaic gaming practices recast literacies research around games and learning, the author argues for continued scrutiny of these playful domains.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2021-04-12 14:08:39","9-27","","1","55","","","Gaming Literacies","","","","","","","en","© 2019 International Literacy Association","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://ila.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rrq.260","","","","_information literacy; _dnd; _layout; _collaborative; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =0.66; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","Technology; Qualitative Research; 6-Adult; Cultural Historical Activity Theory; Digital Literacies; Digital/media literacy; Ethnographic; Methodological perspectives; New Literacies; New Literacy Studies; Popular Culture; Socio-cultural; Theoretical perspectives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this overlooks other ways that play can be meaningful.

In the context of meaningful play (Salen & Zimmerman, 2004) and positive negative experiences (Hopeametsä, 2008), we discuss (1) the impact of shared physical and social realities on death in D&D, (2) the design of death in D&D, and (3) how death in D&D shapes the future play and lives of players. From this, we argue that play can have meaning that transcends game boundaries, subsequently proposing the concept of “pivotal play” to describe appealing, memorable, and transformative play experiences.","2021-04-13","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-20 02:29:28","2021-04-16 02:00:20","15554120211005231","","8","16","","Games and Culture","Pivotal Play","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications QID: Q114772238","","","https://doi.org/10.1177/15554120211005231","_dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _transformative; =rabbit; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _character; _PSYCHOLOGY","Dungeons & Dragons; death; meaningful play; pivotal play; positive negative experiences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The resurgence of tabletop Role-playing Games (RPGs), and their explosion into new media, which we have participated in and enjoyed, invites us to consider their place in redefining remix culture in the twenty-first century. In this chapter we outline our observations as we: Articulate the nature of RPGs as a site of remix. Articulate the ways that tabletop role-players remix using the tools of the digital humanities. Access to diverse materials through digital technology turns role-play-ing gamers, not only scholars, but also everyday people, into remixers. Demonstrate contemporary remix through narrative inquiry into the practices of a successful group of online role-playing gamers, broadcast on Twitch as Critical Role.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","10.4324/9780429355875-22","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 8RUcEAAAQBAJ","","","","_actual play; _copyright; _adaptation; _TTRPG; _citation; =cleaned; =HOT; _LEARNING; _LIBRARY; _MEDIA","Social Science / Media Studies","Navas, Eduardo; Gallagher, Owen; burrough, xtine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a second step, the text describes some of the specific and most salient framing features and strategies used by players during game sessions. By analyzing these through actual gameplay it is possible to identify the ‘transceptional’ border (Bunia) between reality and fiction to be the constitutive moment of role-play where players are both aware of, and immersed in, the fiction they collaboratively construct. Finally, the dissertation adapts Wolf’s theoretical framework in order to discuss and analyze the often overlooked category of “storytelling” TRPGs - one that, as the text argues, rather than focusing on narrative as such, aims at creating gameplay texts with heightened aesthetic and literary value while also enabling players to experience particular forms of immersion and deep emotional involvement. In the conclusion, the dissertation proposes re-conceptualizing literary framing as a defining characteristic of the fictional practice in general across media. In this regard, the dissertation argues, TRPGs reveal how framings are used and adapted in order to enable a specific mode of human interaction which is based on the figuration of emotional complexes via fictional “masks.”","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 03:28:58","","","332","","","","","","","","","","Heidelberg U","Heidelberg","en","","PhD English Literature","","","Zotero","","","","","","_major publication; _identity; _theater; _group dynamics; _playfulness; _metagame; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a mixed-methods approach, this ISDiP follows a team of invested school community members as they planned, implemented, studied, and reflected on the outcomes of initiating targeted social and emotional learning interventions to 16 students from a small alternative school in Anchorage, Alaska. Through a 90-day cycle, the School's Network Improvement Community (NIC) organized and executed an after-school SEL club after data on a district-wide survey indicated that social and emotional learning (SEL) was a necessary focus for the school context. The NIC utilized a self-assessment SEL screener, anecdotal observations, as well as parent, teacher, and student testimonies to justify the outcomes of this study. The researcher found that tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) are a viable, effective, and fun way to help students develop their social and emotional skills. This result was evident based on the mySAEBRS survey results, which demonstrated an average increase of 6.6% across all participants. This data was justified further by the anecdotal observations made by a diverse pool of stakeholders. Based on these results, the NIC was able to expand the SEL/TTRPG intervention to their entire school community and would like to encourage other school contexts to do so as well.","2021-03-24","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:56","","","84","","","","","","","","","","George Fox University","","en","","Doctor of Education (EdD)","","","","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _soft skills; _LEARNING; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, academics have argued for the benefits of game play. These contradictory discourses have led to the question: What are the learning outcomes associated with tabletop role-playing? This study analyzed qualitative semi-directed interviews with nine individuals who have identified themselves as having experienced hardships on which TTRPGs have had a positive effect. Experiences identified by the participants included incarceration, social exclusion, gender transition and mental health-related challenges. It was found that all participants experienced, to varying degrees, social and societal isolation related to their hardships. However, TTRPGs had perceived benefits—for example, self-development, skill development and achievement—which went beyond the gaming context, and had an effect on different aspects of the participant’s lives. I argue that TTRPGs provided a context which acted as a liminal space, helping players transition away from social and societal isolation towards a form of social participation. This suggests that TTRPGs may help players engage in citizenship. This study expands on current RPG research, by looking at the actual experience of playing these games and the long-lasting impact they can have on players.","2021-02-17","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:16:38","2021-05-04 03:31:46","","204","","","","","Magic, Adventure & Social Participation","","","","","Université d'Ottawa / University of Ottawa","Ottawa, ON","en","","Master of Arts degree in Criminology","","","ruor.uottawa.ca","","Accepted: 2021-02-17T14:43:55Z DOI: 10.20381/ruor-26001","","","","_canada; _gender; _minority; _interview; _TTRPG; _belonging; =cleaned; _empirical work; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The consequences of the decision are not unproblematic. The public debate, as well as research, shows that parents have a problem seeing how their style of parenting could correlate with the Convention’s legal text. The parents express hopelessness towards the notion of child upbringing. This thesis is an exploratory pilot study aiming to prepare and generate new knowledge for a project commissioned by Save the Children with the goal to develop a game to decrease the knowledge gap between parents and children regarding what the Convention means for their relationship. The thesis also asks the question: how can a game, played by parents and children meant to teach them about soft values in accordance with the Convention look like. Beyond traditional qualitative research methods, this thesis used Research through Design and developed a presumptive prototype for the project in order to explore the research subject. Findings showed that the games narrative and the power to change the narrative through player choices play an essential part in the participant’s ability to immerse in the game, and that this interactive narrative is closely connected with the ability to learn.

Eighty-five people ages 18-25 were surveyed on their perceived levels of these three variables, as well as how often they played TTRPGs. Responses of those who did play TTRPGs were compared with results of those who did not play TTRPGs. A statistically significant positive correlation was identified in all participants between creativity and self-efficacy, creativity and social skills, and self-efficacy and social skills. Participants who played TTRPGs scored statistically significantly higher in measures of creativity than participants who did not play TTRPGs. There was no statistically significant difference in the two groups in terms of self-efficacy or social skills. These findings, along with previous studies concentrating on possible benefits of TTRPGs, suggest that there is a strong relationship between creativity and playing TTRPGs, and further investigation into ways TTRPGs could be implemented in the treatment of autistic patients are warranted.","2018-07-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","40","","","","","","","","","","Pace University","","en","","Honors College Theses Psychology","","","Zotero","","","","","","_creativity; _student; _self-efficacy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _soft skills; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BADD was a group consisted of parents, teachers, and clergy who were worried about the spiritual and mental development of children, who they saw were at risk of being corrupted by a single game—Dungeons & Dragons. The group campaigned again and again, warning fellow parents about the detrimental effect that this game could have on a child’s life. They believed Dungeons & Dragons had a kind of power over its players—a power that could create meaning and even take children to their eternal doom. This is just one argument for the idea that tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons have the power to create meaning in a person’s life and influence their development.

There are numerous avenues for scientists to get stories into the media; however, scientists need to become better at communicating their research in plain English. Media which are supportive of science stories or programs should be targeted and scientists should become more active at pitching stories. (AQES) The Rolling Stories project turns the AQES call to target media which are supportive of ‘science stories’ into a design activity where scientists are encouraged to both tell their stories and communicate them through creating Table-top Role Playing Games (TRPGs) and then playing them with students. The project goals support the AQES goals  of increasing student participation, public engagement and scientists’ participation. The project expects outcomes in terms of increased engagement through the workshop series and long-lasting outcomes in the form of TRPG game books that can then be shared and re- used in educational and professional contexts.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-05-04 13:32:02","","","","","","","Rolling Stories","","","","","","","en","Consult author(s) regarding copyright matters","","","","","","","","","","_worldbuilding; _motivation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _stem; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the first ethnomusicological study to examine the role of sound in these TRPGs, although previous, related musicological scholarship has focused on video game and computer role-playing games (Cheng, 2014; Miller, 2012). Throughout the thesis, I draw on my own experiences with these games, participant-observation and observation of other TRPG groups, and interviews I completed with eighteen informants. Through analysis and interpretation of data collected using these fieldwork methods, I examine specific examples of how music is used in gaming sessions, explore how the use of music relates to Daniel Mackay’s “imaginary-entertainment environment” (2001), and offer the term “movie simile” to describe common comparisons that players make between film and TRPG soundtracks. My theoretical framework on voice draws from Brian Kane’s model (2014) to discuss how players utilize echos, logos, topos, and technê to create meaning and worlds in their games, as well as to illustrate how real-life experiences with the voice affect a player’s reception of natural and character voices. Additionally, I offer the term “haptic audition” to describe how tactility and space affect the ways in which players experience these sonic gaming environments. Throughout the thesis, I describe my model of sonic and perceptual layers that include the musical layer, the vocal layer, and the third and fourth layers, which include ambient and environmental noises, respectively.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","156","","","","","Dungeons, Dragons, & Star Wars","","","","","The Florida State University","Ann Arbor","en","","Master of Music","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","2434571167","Google Scholar","","ISBN: 9798662467194 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses 27831239","","","https://libkey.io/libraries/2401/pdfexpress/openurl?sid=ProQ:&issn=&volume=&issue=&title=Dungeons%2C+Dragons%2C+%26amp%3B+Star+Wars%3A+Sound+in+Tabletop+Role-Playing+Games&spage=&date=2020-01-01&atitle=Dungeons%2C+Dragons%2C+%26amp%3B+Star+Wars%3A+Sound+in+Tabletop+Role-Playing+Games&au=Jensen%2C+Emma&id=doi:","_GMing; _dnd; _music; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper begins with an exploration of what a table role-playing game is, and compares it to educational theatre techniques, primarily process drama. While there is a significant amount of research being done in how online computer games can be used to benefit the classroom, there is a dearth of research being done on table role-playing games. I argue that, as a non-digital interactive experience run by a facilitator, table role-playing games share a great deal of commonality with the methodology used to implement process drama. However, table role-playings normally do not concern themselves with the specific positive outcomes regarding student learning. In this case study, I design a table role-playing game for a high school English class studying Sophocles' The Antigone, intended to help a classroom instructor achieve specific, targeted objectives. Before implementing the game in the classroom, I describe the revision and modifications that were made to the game after implementing a trial playtest with adult participants. The revised game was then enacted in the high school classroom, and I provide a detailed report of the significant interactions. Upon completion of the game sessions, all participants are interviewed to share their experience and insights into using the table role-playing game and how it impacted their understanding of the text. I conclude this study with my findings, which demonstrate that table role-playing games can be successfully used in the classroom. The next logical step will be to determine what the best practices are, and in what ways the game design methodology can be improved upon.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","314","","","","","","","","","","New York University","New York","en","","Ph.D. Educational Theatre","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","2183869030","","","ISBN: 978-0-438-86323-1 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses 13426011","","","","_literature; _theater; _reading; _yo13-19; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research questions sought to identify which experiences were meaningful, beneficial, and appealing about the game. Through purposive non-random sampling, a total of 60 respondents answered the survey between June and August 2016. Majority of respondents were male, within the age range of 25 - 34 years, and having at least 1 - 3 years of experience. Thematic analysis was used to categorize the data acquired through an online survey. The researcher categorized keywords into three core elements: Creative, Emotional, and Social Experiences. The findings show that there is no doubt role-playing games such as D&D have the potential to entertain, heal, and educate.

"IJ8JNMU8","thesis","2018","Werth, Matthew","Role-Play in the Chinese Classroom","","","","","https://doi.org/10.7275/12026470","Over the past decade, there has been an increasing push for foreign language teachers to use a communicative approach to language instruction. One area this can be seen is through role-plays, activities where students take on a persona other than themselves to complete a task in the target language. Despite the growing popularity of role-play, there has been little empirical research looking at the impact of role-play on students. In particular, the differences between large group and small group role-plays remain virtually unstudied.  This thesis looks at role-play in Chinese language classrooms from the perspectives of both teachers and students. To obtain the teacher perspective educators throughout Massachusetts were surveyed about their attitudes and approach to using role-play. To better understand student attitudes towards role-play, a wide variety of role-plays were observed and data was collected from the participants.  Observations of over fifty role-plays showed that large group role-plays have a wide variety of benefits including: increasing student enjoyment, providing more opportunities for peer learning/teaching, and enabling teachers to give more immediate feedback. These implications as well as other suggestions for how to successfully use role-play in the language classroom are explored more fully later in the thesis. In order to make role-play more accessible to foreign language teachers, a series of role-play lesson plans based on the principles discussed are also provided in the appendix.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-28 15:16:24","2021-05-07 19:16:04","","81","","","","","","","","","","University of Massachusetts Amherst","Amherst","en","","MA Asian Languages and Literatures","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","Publisher: University of Massachusetts Amherst","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the combination of analog and digital mechanisms, from traditional books to the internet, new ways of engaging the fantastic have become increasingly realized in recent years, and this book seeks an understanding of this phenomenon within the discourses of trans- and posthumanism, as well as within a gameist mode. The book explores a number of case studies of foundational TRPGs. Dungeons and Dragons provides an illustration of pulp-driven fantasy, particularly in the way it harmonizes its many campaign settings into a functional multiverse. It also acts as a supreme example of depth within its archive of official and unofficial published material, stretching back four decades. Warhammer 40k and the Worlds of Darkness present an interesting dialogue between Gothic and science-fantasy elements. The Mythos of HP Lovecraft also features prominently in the book as an example of a realized world that spans the literary and gameist modes. Realized fantasy worlds are becoming ever more popular as a way of experiencing a touch of the magical within modern life. Reworking Northrop Frye's definition of irony, Dread Trident theorizes an ironic understanding of this process and in particular of its embodied forms.","2019-11-30","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-28 18:01:59","","","258","","","","","Dread Trident","","","","","Liverpool University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6trBDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.ca/books?id=6trBDwAAQBAJ","_literature; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _distantiation; _EMOTIONS; _wod; _HISTORYOFRPG","Games & Activities / Role Playing & Fantasy; Literary Criticism / Science Fiction & Fantasy; Philosophy / Movements / Humanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The researcher conducted a series of 8 interviews with participants whom he plays the game with in a number of organized game sessions both before and during the course of this research. The Researcher finds that effects to one's identity do not extend to the participants personalities, but are mainly focused on their behavioral and emotional development. The researcher also found that there was a spectrum of different types of characters created by players, ranging from those that were reflections or embodiments of certain aspects of their personality to create new identities or those who create completely new identities, much in line with research conducted by Sherry Turkle on this topic. The researcher also finds that the game can act as a means of gender empowerment should the participant take part in a game group that is encouraging in that manner. The researcher concludes by stating that while all effects to one's identity through playing Dungeons & Dragons would be dependant on a myriad of factors related to the game sessions that player participates in, noting that positive influences can be elicited through gameplay dependant on the nature of the game group. All in all the researcher notes that there is a myriad of avenues for further research within this topic.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-05-07 19:32:06","","","","","","","'Dungeons & Dragons’ and identity","","","","","Malta University","Malta","en","info:eu-repo/semantics/restrictedAccess","BA sociology","","","www.um.edu.mt","","Accepted: 2020-10-27T12:45:52Z Publisher: University of Malta","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their repercussion and referencing in TV shows and the Internet support the increasing awareness in pop culture at the same time that this sort of games is re-configured to meet the modern times in media, keeping their essence of pen, paper and friends around a table. This dissertation analyses the influence of the game in modern texts through its highest representative, Dungeons & Dragons. The successful show Stranger Things serves the purpose of analysing how the nostalgia created around the eighties and its aesthetic use of Dungeons & Dragons as vehicle for the main elements of plot and the focalised vision of the same. The live streaming of role-play sessions has also helped in this spread of the community, like Critical Role, allowing a higher engagement of the audience through the ease of the relaxed atmosphere of friends enjoying their hobby, yet reaching almost a professional level of production and writing. The analysis also discusses the roots of this game in the work of J. R. R. Tolkien and H. P. Lovecraft, highlighting several points of the game like the characterisation of the races, influenced by the concepts in Tolkien’s literature and the addition of a dark element from the cosmic horror genre, introducing recognisable elements of vulnerability, horror and antagonists’ new definitions.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:51:34","2021-05-07 19:33:48","","32","","","","","","","","","","Universidad de Granada","Granada","en","Atribución-NoComercial-SinDerivadas 3.0 España","BA thesis","","","digibug.ugr.es","","Accepted: 2020-07-01T08:51:50Z","","","","_literature; _transmedia; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What are the types of problems that gamemasters face while running games? How do they handle these problems when they do arise? This research set out to answer these questions by applying thematic analysis on a data set collected from 41 Vampire TRPG gamemasters with an online questionnaire.     The results show that there are many types of problems that a gamemaster can face while running their game, including differences in creative agendas; difficult social dynamics; problems in power sharing and problems with bleed – the crossover between character and player. It is also presented that gamemasters use multiple tactics to ensure a safer and more enjoyable game for all participants. These included calibrations, which could be related to the exogenous, endogenous or diegetic frames of the game; directing, which focused on the the diegetic frame of the game and aftercare, which was used to prevent problems in social dynamics after the game, and to facilitate the changing of frames between game and “real life.”      I argue that while gamemasters do have a rather comprehensive understanding of safety, consent and boundary setting, a deeper understanding on the cultural issues affecting the gendered nature of power, emotions and bleed is required, as well as studies on the experiences of players. I also point out that there is indeed a small minority of tabletop gamers that still appear to feel threatened by safety mechanics and by studies such as this.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-05-07 19:35:31","","88","","","","","","","","","","Aalto University","Espoo, Finland","en","","MA in New Media: Game Design and Production","","","aaltodoc.aalto.fi","","Accepted: 2020-05-03T15:00:33Z","","","","_bleed; _GMing; _moral play; _safe space; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _wod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A group of adventurers pause in their pursuit of escape. Stunned, they stare at the die that just rolled poorly, resulting in the loss of a dear friend, his throat ripped out because they could not save him. The players mourn the death of a fictional character who only ever existed within the game. Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a popular role-playing game illustrating the interconnectedness of drama, performance, and games. My presentation will examine this relationship, identifying factors from gameplay that suggest how performance fosters success in D&D for both actual players and fictional characters. Research into dramatic theory and game theory reveals how interdisciplinary concepts such as the “magic circle”, the “lusory attitude”, and uncertainty can apply to elements of D&D (Salen and Zimmerman, Suits, Costikyan). Data collected from in-person observation of D&D sessions, coding participants’ behaviour, and watching for instances of performance (e.g. voice change, pronoun switches, or mimetic gesture), has been combined with theoretical research to determine elements that better facilitate success in the game/campaign. These elements range from emotional situations that provoke players, to forms of invitations encouraging participation (Isbister, White). I have discovered that while in theatre performance acts as a vehicle for story, in D&D the story acts as a vehicle for performance. The in-game performance often facilitates fun between players, as well as leading them to success in the game, so a campaign that maximizes theatricality will not only result in more fun, but also more success.

This research looks at how race and gender intersect (or more often, contrast) within the text and practice of D&D. This study culls data from a wide variety of sources. It includes literary analyses of important source material for the game, such as the work of J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard, describing the way these authors influenced the way the game understands and uses race. It also examines later works that both influence and have been influenced by Dungeons & Dragons. This includes texts like Steven Erikson’s Malazan Book of the Fallen, a fantasy epic that began as a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. In addition to textual analyses, this study includes data and observations taken from interviewing players and observing numerous sessions of D&D. These interviews and observations are essential, as they provide information on how people talk, act, and think around the gaming table, and how players engage critically with concepts of race and gender in and out of the game. The ethnographic work in this study also provides critical information on the characteristics of D&D gaming groups as social units, and how the social qualities of those groups impact the messages imparted during play. The basic conclusion of this study is that knowing that someone plays D&D means very little, while understanding how and why they play D&D is highly informative. While both ii D&D’s origin as a game and its literary basis are marked by a predominance of white male voices, there is a surprising amount of flexibility in the stories that players can tell. While there is no guarantee that players will use their narrative freedom to tell morally uplifting stories (and they often do not) a great deal can be learned from understanding why people enjoy specific tropes and concepts.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-05-07 19:38:28","","205","","","","","Dungeons &amp; Discourse","","","","","Bowling Green State University","","en","","PhD History","","","etd.ohiolink.edu","","","","","","_identity; _history; _gender; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","Fantasy; Race; Dragons; Gender; Dungeons; Intersectionality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is limited research on the lived gaming experience of individuals who play fantasy tabletop role-playing games in live gameplay. Fittingly, the current study utilized a qualitative heuristic research design based on Moustakas’s Heuristic Research Design, Methodology, and Application (1990). This study included five participants (referred to as co-researchers) over the age of 21 who actively participate in fantasy tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) or who have participated in TTRPGs, such as Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), within the last year of the study. Five primary themes were identified that spoke to the collective experience of playing TTRPGs: (a) introduction to TTRPGs and first time playing TTRPGs, (b) participants play TTRPGs because it is social, (c) participants get personal benefits from playing TTRPGs, (d) playing these types of games is a large commitment for participants, and (e) creating stories together. The data gathered in the study were examined with previously completed research in the area of TTRPGs and role-playing games. This study identified and discussed limitations such as researcher bias, time dedicated to a qualitative study, and the total number of participants. Recommendations for future research include exploring levels of experience of TTRPGs players, generalizability with gender, and a suggestion for a mixed-method study to explore further the areas that are limited in qualitative studies.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","136","","","","","An Exploratory Study of Individuals Who Play Fantasy Tabletop Role-Playing Games","","","","","Ashford University","","en","","PhD Psychology","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_assessment; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TTRPGs remain a relatively unexplored design space, to the detriment of designers and system homebrewers– those who wish to modify existing TTRPG systems, rather than write new ones. A useful solution to this issue is to compose a pattern language representative of these systems. A pattern language provides a useful blueprint for designers of complex design systems, simplifying the TTRPG design process. In this thesis, we create a conceptual language which presents a simple-to-understand method of developing a TTRPG’s core elements alongside a set of pre-defined options and goals. This pattern language will then be simulated by an application developed within the JavaScript engine Blockly, as both a demonstration and as a tool with which designers can write systems. This tool, which we have named Assemble, will demonstrate how designers could benefit from utilizing pattern languages in computer-aided design contexts for TTRPG systems.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-05-07 19:42:07","","45","","","","","","","","","","UC Santa Cruz","Santa Cruz","en","","MS COMPUTATIONAL MEDIA","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","_procedural storytelling; _software; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"TLQD8GL7","thesis","2018","Strickland, Klaira","Defining Fan Subcultures within Dungeons & Dragons","","","","","","First created in 1974, the largest table-top role-playing game (RPG) Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) started out as a war game where multiple players could join in and fight monsters. Grounded in fantasy conventions and as a way to explore fantasy genres, Dungeons & Dragons popularity continued through new editions and add-ons. In addition, Dungeons & Dragons legacy has lived on in the gaming world as the father of most RPGs and fantasy games with a large fan following across various editions and over multiple decades. The fan following is still evident today due to D&D’s foundations in high fantasy. An exploration of the ways in which fantasy narrative plays a role in the fan culture of D&D is necessary to understand how the aspects of fantasy affect gameplay and how players view D&D. By conducting a study of Dungeons & Dragons players which focused on close game play, players’ relationships to other fantasy genres, and how players interacted with game conventions, I explored the ways in which Dungeons & Dragons introduced players to fantasy and how they participated in a fandom. This paper will present the findings of the study as well as situate Dungeons & Dragons in relationship to other fantasy and gaming subcultures.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Western Illinois University","","","","MA English","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study is meant as an examination of the role of audience and narrator in Dungeons & Dragons and the game’s narrative elements using the lenses of Wayne Booth’s theories on the narrator as stated in his book The Rhetoric of Fiction and Joseph Campbell’s theory on the monomyth, or the “hero’s journey”, as stated in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. While Dungeons & Dragons has been studied for its psychological and philosophical qualities, very little research has been conducted on the game’s literary qualities and its relationship between the author and their audience. This thesis serves a jumping-off point into an area of study that is ripe with topics and themes to be studied.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-16 01:08:30","","","36","","","","","The Hero Never Leaves the Tavern","","","","","Northern Illinois University","DeKalb","en","","MA English","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_plot structure; _dnd; _anthropology; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The case in point is a famous game of the Seventies, Dungeons & Dragons. The Rule Book of Dungeons & Dragons is analyzed, paying attention to the features that support the gaming activity, but also to the literary elements embedded in the game.

Dungeons & Dragons is a collaborative and highly social activity, therefore requiring significant social investment and engagement by each member of the community (Adams, 2013, p. 77). Adams (2013) furthermore concluded that the game served as a “vehicle for players to consistently make an effort to socialize in structured ways” (p. 77). However, these communities continue to be associated with social ineptitude and further stigmatized by association with psychiatric disorders (Lis, Chiniara, Biskin & Montoro, 2015, p. 381-382). I was introduced to a Dungeons & Dragons community by a mutual friend. After an initial observation of several hours, I conducted preliminary interviews with both leaders (Dungeon Masters), in succession. Afterwards, I conducted a follow-up interview with just one of the leaders. This paper demonstrates the relationship between shared fantasy and collaborative consensus building, but pays particular attention to the unique jargon and conversational style of the community. I construct several taxonomies through thematic analysis, exploring the strategies gamers use to construct shared fantasy, and a shared repertoire based on crossmedia references, politics, and the history of the game. This paper furthermore analyzes the role of report-talk, a typically masculine conversational style that uses the exchange of information as a means by which to compete for and communicate status (Tannen 1991). I explore how these values and styles serve to alienate women and impede female participation.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Georgia State University","","","","BA Applied Linguistics and English as a Second Language","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_dnd; _anthropology; _gender; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To accomplish this goal, we propose a system called MTG that listens to players' speeches in order to recognize the context of the current scene and generate background music to match the scene. A speech recognition system is used to transcribe players' speeches to text and a supervised learning algorithm detects when scene transitions take place. In its current version, a scene transition occurs whenever the emotional state of the narrative changes. Moreover, the background music is not generated, but selected based on its emotion from a library of hand-authored pieces. As future work, we plan to generate the background music considering the current scene context and the probability of scene transition. We also consider to retrieve more information from the narrative to detect scene transitions, such as the scene's location and time of the day as well as actions taken by characters.","2017-09-19","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 17:02:09","2021-05-07 19:51:48","","","","13","","","MTG","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c)","","","","ojs.aaai.org","","Number: 1","","","","_music; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned","natural language processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"6R9DV4WN","thesis","2017","Bruner, Scott M.","Constructing a Canon for"" Dungeons & Dragons"": A Generative Analysis of Gary Gygax's Appendix N","","","","","","In 1974, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson created the world’s first role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons. D&D offered an entirely new avenue for readers to interact with fantasy literature; instead of simply reading fantastic novels, players were welcome to inhabit their worlds. This thesis provides both a contextualization of D&D within our literary history – as a narrative-creating game which relies on performance for its actualization – and an analysis of two of the primary texts responsible for its game world diegesis: Poul Anderson’s Three Hearts and Three Lions and Fritz Leiber’s Fafhrd and Gray Mouser cycle of stories. This analysis offers a generative method for examining artistic influences on the nascent medium of tabletop roleplaying, a new ergodic form of literature. Through an analysis of Anderson’s novel and Leiber’s short stories, we are able to understand how Gygax constructed a new post-modern mythological canon, by interpellating literary elements, perspectives, and narrative decisions, from the popular fictions of early 20th century pulp fiction that he catalogued in D&D’s Appendix N. This investigation illuminates the importance of literary tradition for creating new legends for our games, in our classic analog field and in our emerging digital landscape, and argues for the necessity of encouraging further curiosity into how our literary traditions shape the imaginations of our present and future game designers, developers, and artists.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","78","","","","","Constructing a Canon for"" Dungeons & Dragons""","","","","","San Diego State University","San Diego","en","","MA English","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_dnd; _canon; _TTRPG; _appendixN; _citation; =cleaned; =PM-obsidianized; _LIBRARY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study specifically looks at the game Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition and included interviews with six participants on how they balanced the collaborative narrative environment and expressing creativity while working within a system with extensive rules and guidelines for how the game functions. While participants did acknowledge that the rules were important, the rules themselves function more as paratexts, or guidelines. They functioned to create a consistent, understandable environment within which to create a narrative, but participants recognized that if these guidelines hamper the enjoyment or flow of the game and story they could be changed or ignored for the players’ benefit. Furthermore, players were more likely to break the rules or allow others to do so if there was a creative and interesting narrative purpose, as it was important to allow all players to have agency and input in the narrative and to ensure that the story itself was enjoyable for all involved.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","Chapel Hill","","","M.S. in School of Information and Library Science","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_collaborative; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","From Tabletop to Desktop: How communication affordances in tabletop role-playing games change in the transition from offline to online play","","","","","https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/25534","This paper seeks to analyze the differences in communication affordances between offline and online variants of tabletop, or “pen & paper” role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. The main research we will be answering is how communication affordances in these role-playing games changes in the transition from an offline social setting to an online mediated setting. Theories on layers of communication in role-playing games by Gary Allen Fine will be discussed, as will frame theory by Ervin Goffman. The methodological approach of the paper is to analyze the online role-playing platform Roll20.net and try to identify communicative affordances within the platform that may lead to a change in communication between the participants of a role-playing game. Several communicative and gameplay tools found within the online platform will be analyzed. Several of the findings lead to a possible change in communication between several of the layers the theory of Gary Allen Fine suggests. On one hand, role-playing online may lead to a more fragmented type of communication, as the computer desktop (and therefore mediated communication) acts as a barrier between players. On the other hand, the affordances within Roll20 could also lead players (who understand the inner workings of the platform) to a more streamlined game-experience, absolving the need for unnecessary and/or noisy communication. Lastly, the analysis also leads to unexpected avenues of possible follow up research. The implication on immersion in the online variant of role-playing is still up for debate, as there are both findings that would possibly suggest a more in depth and immersive role-playing experience than the offline variant, but also vice-versa. Cheating is another possibility that raises questions through this research which are still unanswered but interesting enough to follow up.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-11 19:29:59","","","24","","","","","From Tabletop to Desktop","","","","","Utrecht University","Utrecht","en","","BA. thesis","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_virtual table; _oral communication; _conversation; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Heralded as a return to form by conservative Christians, the Satanic Panic ousted occult undertones lurking in the shadows of America’s popular culture. Conservative Christians subjected Dungeons & Dragons to the burning stake of this modern-day witch hunt. This thesis investigates the “why” and “how” of the Satanic Panic vis-à-vis this tabletop role-playing game set in a fantasy universe. Applying an interdisciplinary approach, this thesis presents primary texts and historical documents of the Satanic Panic and then proceeds to address the Satanic Panic sociologically. Finally, this thesis performs ideological criticism on an anti-Dungeons & Dragons text to demonstrate historical, sociological, and ideological trends in a major movement within conservative American Christianity, the influence of which reverberates to this day.","2020-05-26","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:48:23","2021-05-07 20:03:57","","","","","","","A Dungeon Master's Guide to the Satanic Panic","","","","","","","en","Baylor University projects are protected by copyright.

The aim is to create a working translation of The Player’s Handbook which can be used by interested parties who are somewhat familiar with the source material. First, the nature of the text is determined and analysed, after which various complications and challenges that are specific to the text are discussed. Based on these findings, a suitable translation strategy or strategies will be chosen and applied to the translation. The conclusion of this thesis states that, in order to produce such a working translation of The Player’s Handbook, a combination of several strategies will need to be applied.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:56","","","100","","","","","","","","","","Utrecht University","Utrecht","en","","Master's Thesis","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_dnd; _translation; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As long as youth entertainment has values that can be seen as going against the established values of the preceding generation, a moral panic could take place. The purpose of this research was to analyze how moral panics centered on youth entertainment begin and gain traction. To do this, the research was focused on the 1980s moral panic around tabletop roleplaying games, specifically Dungeons & Dragons. By tracing the origin of the moral panic to the fear of cults and occult from the 1970s, we can find more context as to why some individuals believed that role playing games could cause adolescents to use the games as a style of dangerous escapism or as a gateway to the occult. To further understand this moral panic, an analysis of some of the major detractors of role playing games was done, as well as researching the role the media played in cultivating the moral panic. With a greater understanding on how moral panics begin and gain traction, this research can be used to compare and contrast other moral panics around youth entertainment.","2018-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-30 19:51:41","2021-05-07 20:11:07","","","","","","","","","","","","Augusta University","Augusta","en","","BA Honor History, Anthropology & Philosophy","","","augusta.openrepository.com","","Accepted: 2019-01-30T21:10:23Z","","","","_moral panic; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As part of this process, I developed my own tabletop role playing game, Vestige, to test these strategies with groups of players. The strategies I developed were synthesized from and inspired by existing role playing games, particularly those that are well known among queer gamers, though many lesser known games were reviewed as well. The investigation culminated with the implementation of an Affinities and Aversions system in Vestige, which encourages the player to play with shifting relationships and identities. As a result, even the most trope-based characters will undergo some sort of identity fluctuation through the process of extended play. The players, in turn, are given game space and even encouraged to explore gender and sexuality vicariously through the characters they create.","2017-04-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","Postmortem of ""Queer Play","","","","","Thompson Rivers University","","","","","","","","","","","","","_lgbtq; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then process these interactions to render a story following the rules and using the knowledge base from a popular RPG.

This study was conducted on a sample of 35 fantasy gamers within the North Bay, Ontario community. Field notes on 20 gameplay sessions were taken as well as transcriptions of conversational interviews and follow-up interviews with participants. Finding suggest that Dungeons & Dragons operates as a wispy community (Fine & Van den Scott, 2011) that demands social stratification and regulation due to the chance and ambiguity embedded within the game. In order to regulate shared fantasy, Game Masters had to engage in complex role negotiations and mechanisms of social repair. Findings indicate that for Dungeons & Dragons to operate to shared normative expectations, underlying trust and the preservation of the shared narrative must be socially upheld. A failure to maintain narrative-focused or for a Game Master to effectively navigate their social role causes players to engage in role-distancing behaviours or dismiss themselves from the wispy community completely. This research serves to highlight the importance of share social meaning and structure in all societies regardless of size (macro or micro) or stratification (rigid or wispy).","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 03:52:15","","","63","","","","","Lock-Downs and Walk-Outs","","","","","Nipissing University","North Bay, ON","en","","Master Sociology","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_fandom; _group dynamics; _canada; _confidence; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

System mechanics and character creation options have been tooled toward evoking genre types and aesthetics ever since the first “Vancian wizard” memorised a spell before setting out to adventure.  Naturally, when RPGs turned toward the Gothic, they did the same thing: riffing off the assembled archetypes and stereotypes of myth, film and literature to create an infrastructure of characters for players to occupy and navigate.  This paper explores the most overtly Gothic RPG yet designed, analysing two different approaches to establishing a framework of archetypes that will be familiar to players while also curating a particular aesthetic mood.  Vampire: the Masquerade​ bakes literary references into its heavily stereotyped clans and sects, strongly associating the two and extending the game experience step by step into new and broader territories.  Vampire: the Requiem presents five recognisable archetypes, more clearly derived from particular mythic, filmic or literary concepts of the vampire, and five thematic political groups that interact with them in a way offering greater variety.  This paper will establish the Gothic credentials and objectives of the two games in their own terms, explore how the playable character options embody and serve the games’ vision of the Gothic, and proceed toward a classic ‘compare and contrast’ conclusion, looking at how successive editions of the games have modernised these archetypes to meet evolving perceptions of what exactly Gothic roleplaying should be.","2018-10-27","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:48:43","2021-05-08 01:12:16","","","","","","","Bleeding Genre Dry","","","","","","","en","","","","","hcommons.org","","","","","","_stereotype; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _wod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Reimagining Gothic 4 - Gothic Archetypes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This lead to the research of variant rules that only required these rolls on part of the players, and we were delighted to discover that the legendary 1971 Blackmoor campaign of Dave Arneson was played with standard dice only.

A part of the argument is concerned with a relatively weak position of Dungeons & Dragons in Poland compared to the English market and with the Polish RPG players’ lack of interest in the market of digital materials for tabletop RPGs. The main hypothesis, however, connects the Polish absence from community content programs with how the long absence of professional systems and the permanently small market of commercial RPGs in Poland might have increased the intensity of prosumption of RPGs among Polish fans but simultaneously limited their chance to gain skills and knowledge necessary to publish and market the results of this prosumption on a professional or semi-professional level. Statements of Jan Sielicki – the only Polish RPG designer who published numerous and successful supplements under community content programs – are quoted to reinforce this hypothesis and show how Sielicki gained the necessary skills outside of the Polish RPG fandom.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:02:15","","59–74","","12","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Polskie Towarzystwo Badania Gier (Games Research Association of Poland)","","","","_literature; _fandom; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent times, the evolution of the imaginary worlds found in speculative works of fiction appears to favour diversity and inclusiveness, keeping in touch with wider societal trends. This transition in fantastic chronotopes is extensively chronicled in the genre of Tabletop Role-Playing Games, or TRPGs for short. The present paper aims to examine the evolution of fantastical landscapes within the very influential TRPG genre through the combined framework of narrative and cultural theories. The settings of the most successful TRPGs, Dungeons and Dragons and World of Darkness, will serve as examples. The results will provide valuable insights into how and why the worlds of speculative fiction change over time, often in response to wider societal change","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-28 18:01:23","","218–229","","2","1","","","The Evolution of Fantastical Storyworlds","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: ExCentric","","","","_storytelling; _worldbuilding; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _wod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design of these games involves tradeoffs between two values, which are sometimes labeled “realism” and “playability”. These values are ordinarily understood to be wholly independent and competing. Using resources drawn from John Rawls's conception of political theory as a search for a “realistic utopia”, I show how these values can instead be under-stood as aspects of the more general value of creating and conceiving a realistic fantasy through the medium of game play. I also explain how realism operates differently as a constraint on tabletop role-playing games from how it operates in realistic video games and live-action role-playing.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 02:21:01","","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_worldbuilding; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JZHFY5DB","thesis","2020","Lasley, Joe","An Examination of Gaming Environments in Dungeons and Dragons Groups","","","","","https://digital.sandiego.edu/dissertations/170","Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TRPG) like Dungeons & Dragons are unique phenomena within the topics of game-based learning and gamification of leadership development. Games in general are used for both game-based learning (learning from playing games) and as sources of inspiration for gamification: the application of game design elements in non-game contexts like business or education. Many potential benefits of playing TRPGs have been observed including transformative experiences linked to collective creativity. Knowing more about the transformative potential of TRPGs can inform facilitation of creative learning environments and guide the use of TRPGs for leadership development. The concept of a holding environment frames play and creativity as activities that promote personal growth embedded in a psychological or group environment. Drawing from a developmental environment framework, a gaming environment can be considered as the psychological group environment present while playing a TRPG. Applying this developmental environment framework to TRPG groups builds on previous research that reports transformative growth in TRPG experiences by providing a group level of analysis. This research explored gaming environments in TRPGs, specifically Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (D&D 5e). This qualitative study employed content analysis, group observations, and interviews for data collection and analysis. A group of participants was solicited to play D&D 5e specifically for this research. Thematic analysis was used to identify group interaction patterns by observing the group playing D&D 5e over the course of several sessions. Then, semi-structured interviews with the participants were conducted to investigate individual perspectives of specific observations from the group sessions. Interview topics included descriptions of the group of players, defining events in the group, and factors influencing the play experience. Recordings of gaming sessions and transcripts of individual interviews were subjected to continued analysis. Findings indicated that the gaming environment was a psychologically layered container which depended on the use of authority in leader-member relationships and utilized framing and storytelling processes for containing emotions. These findings can be used to inform the design of TRPGs for leadership development and expand how we construct knowledge about group environments in creative contexts.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 03:52:43","","","174","","","","","","","","","","University of San Diego","San Diego","en","","PhD Education","","","Google Scholar","","QID: Q113164493","","","","_immersion; _group dynamics; _dnd; _leadership; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Islendigasögur","","","","https://hal.univ-lorraine.fr/hal-01870170","Playing a dwarf, an elf, a berserker barbarian, or fighting wargs, frost giants and trolls, are among the many situations where direct or indirect references to Old Norse literature may be expressed during a game session of Dungeons and Dragons. This game is considered as one of the very first tabletop role playing games (Fine, 1983; Ewalt, 2013). This paper offers to analyse how references to Old Norse tales (sagas and Eddas) appear in productions of the cultural industries and echoes research about mythical and religious elements in contemporary games (Bainbridge, 2013). In order to show the relevance of Dungeons and Dragons as a case study to understand contemporary reception of Old Norse traditions, I will develop a cultural approach using anthropology and communication sciences (Di Filippo, 2016). In the first part, I will show how Dungeons and Dragons borrows elements from Old Norse literature among other cultural traditions. Such elements can be more or less explicit references, whether if they derive from intermediary works such as fantasy literature written by J. R. R. Tolkien (Simek, 2005), Robert E. Howard and other writers, or if they try to offer a mise en scene of medieval Scandinavia, within accessories such as Legends and Lore and Historical references — Vikings. This first section will allow to understand how the meaning and the form of traditional elements have evolved in a process that the philosopher Hans Blumenberg (1979) has called “Work on myth” (see also Di Filippo, 2016). In the second part, I will address the question of the cultural impact and influences that Dungeons and dragons has had until nowadays and how it has contributed to the spreading of Old Norse references. The famous table top role playing game indeed has a huge influence on nowadays culture: in literature, movies, TV shows, and several kinds of games : videogames, card games or other type of tabletop games (Barton, 2008). D&D can therefore be considered as a cultural crossroad regarding Old Norse reception. Moreover, roleplayers participate in a “community of practices”, which interrogates the social dimension of this cultural phenomenon. Through those different parts, this paper offers a first insight into the multi-dimensional aspect of the reception of Old Norse traditions within roleplaying games as a cultural phenomenon.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-16 01:29:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","The Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies; University of Iceland Centre for Medieval Studies","Reykjavík","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_storytelling; _literature; _dnd; _tolkien; _anthropology; _history; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Skipping this vital process often leaves games with beautiful, but ultimately empty and meaningless worlds, and abstract, disconnected mechanics. The objective of this thesis was to study and present ways to intertwine the mechanics and the story of a game. The thesis studied several methods of worldbuilding to create a step-by-step process of worldbuilding, and used the set approach to construct a fictional fantasy world as a campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game, building each part with applying the same rules in layers. This fantasy world was then used as a basis for an adventure module, built using similar process. The aim of the process was to build a game world that would link the story aspects of the world with the mechanics of the game as tightly as possible. The end result product of the thesis was Working Title: Dream Stone, an adventure module for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. The adventure takes place in a fictional world created using the process detailed in this thesis. However, more time and resources would have been needed to complete the worldbuilding process in its entirety, as well as to refine the product. Additionally, more playtesting would have been required to gain full understanding of the functionality of the adventure. Despite this, the final product managed to produce valuable information regarding the processes of worldbuilding in games.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","60","","","","","Worldbuilding in Games","","","","","South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences","","en","","BA thesis in Design","","","Google Scholar","","Publisher: Kaakkois-Suomen ammattikorkeakoulu","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The writer engages in an intensive and sustained analysis of the psychic material (including dreams and active imagination) that emerges in relation to engagement with the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition (Wizards of the Coast, 2014). The approach is phenomenological, and grounded in the psychology of C. G. Jung. The concepts of settler colonialism and indigeneity, discussed in response to the emergent psychic content, are explored in relation to one another as well as to gaming. Through the work’s continual reflexive turn toward its own content, insights are gained about the nature of gaming and the gamer’s psyche. As an offer toward the understanding of compulsive gaming-related psychiatric disorders (World Health Organization, 2018; American Psychiatric Association, 2013), it is suggested that a key danger of compulsive gaming may be its illusion of safety, providing a sense of potency, agency, and immersion in a magic circle (Huizinga, 1955) that is apart from reality. A multilayered understanding of the relationship between settler consciousness and indigeneity is developed. It is discovered that, in circumstances where imposing Indigenous values on an individual contravenes that individual’s genuine nature, this imposition can itself be a colonial act.","2018","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","202","","","","","Settlers, Gamers, & Identity Politics","","","","","St. Stephen’s College","Edmonton, Alberta","en","","MASTER OF PSYCHOTHERAPY AND SPIRITUALITY","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_mental disorder; _therapy; _identity; _dnd; _politics; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To introduce the gamification elements and lay the foundation for character analysis, we start the semester with a character creation assignment (which is labeled as a “dossier” to fit the overall theme) and a related discussion. Our use of a gamification assignment and follow-up discussion addresses ideological perceptions of identity via avatars and creates a safe space in the classroom for individualized student identities. The dossier task leads into discussions of gaming stereotypes and representation with an emphasis on challenging binaries present in this medium.

Comparative sales analysis of two editions of Dungeons and Dragons and their competitor Pathfinder, showcases a strong correlation between unrestricted availability of online content and improved sales performance. A further comparison of Wizard of the Coast’s recent digital content platform for Dungeons and Dragons analyses the factors in presenting digital content necessary to encourage a “willingness to pay” in the selected audiences.

Throughout middle school and high school my friends and I would gather almost every weekend, spending hours using numbers, probability, and optimization to build models that we could use to simulate almost anything. That’s right. My big secret is simple. I was a high school mathematical modeler. Of course, our weekend mathematical models didn’t bear any direct relationship to the models we explored in our mathematics and science classes. You would probably not even recognize our regular gatherings as mathematical exercises. If you looked into the room, you’d see a group of us gathered around a table, scribbling on sheets of paper, rolling dice, eating pizza, and talking about dragons, magical spells, and sword fighting. So while I claim we were engaged in mathematical modeling, I suspect that very few math classes built models like ours. After all, how many math teachers have constructed or had their students construct a mathematical representation of a dragon, a magical spell, or a swordfight? And yet, our role-playing games (RPGs) were very much mathematical models of reality — certainly not the reality of our everyday experience, but a reality nonetheless, one intended to simulate a particular kind of world. Most often for us this was the medieval, high-fantasy world of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), but we also played games with science fiction or modern-day espionage settings. We learned a lot about math, mythology, medieval history, teamwork, storytelling, and imagination in the process. And, when existing games were inadequate vehicles for our imagination, we modified them or created new ones. In doing so, we learned even more about math. Now that I am a mathematics professor, I find myself reflecting on those days as a “fantasy modeler” and considering various questions. What is the relationship between my two interests of fantasy games and mathematics? Does having been a gamer make me a better mathematician or modeler? Does my mathematical experience make me a better gamer? These different aspects of my life may seem mostly unconnected; indeed, the “nerd” stereotype is associated with both activities, but despite public perception, the community of role-players includes many people who are not scientifically-minded. So we cannot say that role-players like math, or math-lovers role-play, because “that is simply what nerds do.” To get at the deeper question of how mathematics and role-playing are related, we first need to look at the processes of gaming, game designing, and modeling","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:49:07","2021-05-11 02:37:04","99-113","","","","","","Coming Out of the Dungeon","","","","","McFarland Publishing","","en","","","","","core.ac.uk","","Publisher: Fisher Digital Publications","","","","_dice; _mathematics; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","Sklar, Jessica K; Sklar, Elizabeth S","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many of the women interviewed described being subjected to gendered behavioral expectations both in their everyday life and during gameplay. With an empowering gaming group, however, roleplay allowed the participants to challenge, and subvert, those gendered expectations.

With a multi-method qualitative approach (including digital ethnography and in-depth interviews), we empirically studied how people appropriate existing technologies and adapt their offline practices to play tabletop games remotely. We identify three themes that describe people's game and social experience during remote play: creating a shared tabletop environment (shared space), enabling a collective understanding (shared information and awareness), and facilitating a communal temporal experience (shared time).

This paper explores the theory of different rule-playing `stances' emerging from the theory of role playing games and asks if this might also have juridic or regulatory application. As context, this paper looks to the role playing game `Wraith: The Oblivion', particularly for its unique use of roles to shape identity through the `shadow' persona.","2007","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-16 01:15:41","2021-05-25 17:46:36","477-492","","3","3","","Law, Culture & Human.","Voicing the Shadow - Rule-Playing and Roleplaying in Wraith","","","","","","","en","","","","","HeinOnline","","QID: Q56484918","","","","_storytelling; _typology; _mechanics; _rpg theory; _the forge; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY; _wod; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The synergy between law and literature is possible, among other re asons, due to the fact that human experience can be considered as a nomos in which socially constructed normative issues have a present frequency. If role-playing games are understood as phenomena of literary “text”, therefore susceptible to dynamics of interaction with questions alluding to socio-legal phenomena, it is possible to use the lessons on law and literature to obtain, among others, two Objectives: a didactic one, teaching about law and its debates, and a critical one, encouraging questions about the aspects studied. The above is more feasible when addressing the narrative and simulation dimensions that role-playing games can have, especially due to the influence of the notion of agency in them, which allow for “experiences” in which the impact of the law is identified. (or his absence) about characters and third-party stakeholders. This type of interactions also allows sensitization and empathy to those who lack effective normative protection in phenomena similar to those that occur in real life.

On the surface, these fields might appear to be worlds apart, but we found many congruities between them. Both follow a variety of analogous methodologies, including a focus on iterative design, peer-reviewed testing processes, design-led creative approaches to problem-solving, and the use of multidisciplinary practices to create more substantial results. Moreover, both fields strive to create relevant materials for their clients, and rely on both qualitative and quantitative methods of assessment. Additionally, the interactive learning and knowledge sharing fa-cilitated by tabletop roleplaying games function similarly to the way multidisciplinary research teams collaborate to solve real world problems. These parallels have implications for new directions in applied anthropology education and research design. We note how these fields both encourage their practitioners to syncretize skills and knowledge in areas beyond their training, and suggest techniques which can hopefully benefit social science researchers working in a wide range of settings. Additionally, we present ideas for the creation of collaborative learning environments, adaptations to field school training techniques, and the design of collaborative research forums.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","70-80","","","","","","Games and Gaming","","","","","","","en","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_anthropology; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cependant, nous avons pu relever de nombreuses similitudes avec une psychothérapie, sans même qu’il ne soit nécessaire de modifier cette activité. Ce travail entreprend donc d’explorer au-delà de ces premières constatations, et vise à tester cette théorie d’abord par la lecture et la comparaison de la bibliographie, puis de manière exploratoire sous forme d’une activité thérapeutique. Dans sa première partie, cette thèse présente ce qu’est le jeu de rôle sur table (ou papier) moderne. Elle présente notamment les bases de son rapprochement avec les psychothérapies. Dans sa deuxième partie, elle explorera l’essence-même des psychothérapies, à commencer par ce qui fait l’efficacité et la nature d’une psychothérapie. Ensuite, elle cherchera toutes les formes psychothérapeutiques qui sont à rapprocher du jeu de rôle, au premier rang desquelles la narrative therapy. Enfin, cette partie fera le lien entre jeu de rôle sur table et psychothérapie, de manière théorique et pratique (en mettant en avant les utilisations qui existent déjà du jeu de rôle, et même du jeu de rôle sur table). La troisième partie présentera notre approche exploratoire. Elle présentera d’abord la méthode générale de notre approche, avant de s’attarder sur les sept patients qui ont participé à une activité thérapeutique sous forme de jeu de rôle. Ce travail sur la place psychothérapeutique potentielle du jeu de rôle sur table pose (ou repose) les jalons d’une voie peu explorée, à ce jour éparpillée dans une littérature peu connue, mais dont les premiers résultats sont très encourageants; mais questionne également sur la nature de ce qu’est la psychothérapie, à une époque où le nombre d’écoles et de techniques est à son paroxysme.","2020-10-02","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-05-27 01:12:27","","161","","","","","","","","","","FACULTÉ DES SCIENCES MEDICALES ET PARAMEDICALES DE MARSEILLE","Marseille","fr","","Doctorat de médecine","","","dumas.ccsd.cnrs.fr","","","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =bibliography analyzed; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work; _theoretical work; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an inherently collaborative form of narrative, the TRPG demonstrates a unique relationship between author and audience, as participants take on both roles during play. Previous narratological models of author-audience interaction are insufficient to understand the way that authorship functions in the TRPG, and the rise of actual play shows, where TRPGs are broadcast for an audience of nonparticipants, adds an extra layer of complexity to these author-audience relations. This thesis identifies key narrative elements of the TRPG, including game mechanics, framing, and collaboration, and examines how popular actual play shows and their graphic adaptations engage with these elements to create their narratives. This examination indicates that TRPGs create complex author-webs where each participant is both author and audience, and this influence pushes actual play shows and further adaptations of TRPG narratives to expand the ways in which audiences can influence and interact with narratives as they are created. The TRPG genre continues to explore how these elements can be developed beyond traditional understandings of narrative, and this development provides a framework for further narratological study of interactive works, which will only continue to evolve and grow in popularity and complexity in the continuing digital era.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-23 12:53:30","2021-06-21 13:25:10","","66","","","","","Tabletop Role-Playing Games and the Actual Play Show","","","","","Virginia Tech","Blacksburg","en","In Copyright","Master","","","vtechworks.lib.vt.edu","","Accepted: 2021-06-16T08:01:03Z Artwork Medium: ETD Interview Medium: ETD","","","","_storytelling; _actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In producing the game, West End Games contributed significantly to defining and organizing the storyworld, refining and expanding the scope of Star Wars by integrating some earlier transmedial extensions while excluding others. Coming at an early point in the franchise’s history, before Lucasfilm exerted as much control over its licensees, The Roleplaying Game offers an opportunity to examine the role that licensed game designers can play as architects and gatekeepers of transmedia worldbuilding, codifying what is and is not remembered within the storyworld. The Roleplaying Game has often been reduced to a footnote in both the popular and academic history of Star Wars transmedia, but beyond adapting the Galaxy Far, Far Away to a setting for imaginative tabletop roleplaying, The Roleplaying Game is also a foundational document for the last three decades of the Star Wars franchise, serving as the early ‘story bible’ for the Expanded Universe, the interconnected network of Star Wars paratexts codified by the licensing department of Lucasfilm during the 1990s. The hundreds of Star Wars novels, comics, games and other transmedia productions that came with the franchise’s dramatic rebirth in the 1990s bear the stamp of the worldbuilding labour of West End Games.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-18 01:05:37","2021-06-23 00:51:00","145-168","","2","14","","","Making and remaking the Galaxy Far, Far Away","","","","","","","en","","","","","Project MUSE","","Publisher: Liverpool University Press QID: Q114731353","","","","_storytelling; _worldbuilding; _copyright; _transmedia; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _cultural transmission; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"BJB52649","thesis","2019","Bestor, Nicholas Charles Lyon","Playing in licensed storyworlds : games, franchises, and fans","","","","","https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/76188","Licensed games—analog or digital games that are made under contract using pre-existing intellectual properties—bring together the narrative trajectories of their storyworld, the production histories of their creation, the affective traces of their fandoms, and the interpersonal dynamics of their play. This dissertation examines the intersection of the industrial practices of licensing, the textual properties of transmediality, and the creative process of worldbuilding through the lens of licensed games. Licensed games have frequently been dismissed as derivative and overly commercial; my aim is to embrace the redundancies and contradictions of licensed games. Licensing, in which owners of intellectual property sell the rights for use of an IP for a limited period, provides the framework but not the boundaries of these ludic paratexts that stage a complex negotiation of popular storyworlds and fannish affect.     In this dissertation, I explore how three different popular storyworlds are built and shared, explored and negotiated, experienced and felt. The first chapter examines how games have contributed to the growth and continuation of the Star Wars universe. In the second chapter, I survey how the design of rules in games based on the A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones franchise inflects and influences engagement with Westeros. And in my final chapter, I explore what I call a post-licensed game, Warhammer 40,000: Conquest, and the frequently fraught communal process of supporting a card game once its licensing and production have ended.     These licensed games provide richly textured case studies of the negotiation between industrial stakeholders, texts, and fans. Utilizing a combination of textual analysis, participant observation and interviews with players, I argue that licensed games are a fertile medium through which popular brands, franchises, and storyworlds are productively transmediated. How these games draw upon the subjective and affective dimensions of our investment in popular storyworlds reveals much about game design, media franchising, and the creative processes of worldbuilding inherent to both. Licensed games allow us to play in a storyworld, and their modes of engagements foreground the playful ways we experience and understand the transmedially expansive franchises that dominate popular culture.","2019-08-15","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2021-06-23 01:30:31","","223","","","","","","","","","","U Texas at Austin","Austin","en","","Ph.D.","","","repositories.lib.utexas.edu","","Accepted: 2019-10-11T17:25:01Z DOI: 10.26153/tsw/3277","","","","_storytelling; _worldbuilding; _transmedia; _TTRPG; _cultural transmission; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aihetta on tutkittu tähän mennessä kohtalaisen vähän ja tutkimuskirjallisuudessa on selvä aukko. Tästä huolimatta pöytäroolipelien pelaajamäärät kasvavat joka vuosi räjähdysmäisesti. Tämä osoittaa, että ilmiö on tutkimisen arvoinen myös kielenoppimisen näkökulmasta. Tässä laadullisessa tutkimuksessa toteutettiin kolmen pelikerran mittainen pöytäroolipelikokeilu neljälle korkeakouluopiskelijalle, joilla ei ollut suoraa kokemusta pöytäroolipeleistä. Nämä osallistujat myös kokivat omat englannin kielen taitonsa korkeintaan kohtalaisiksi. Kaikki pelikerrat videokuvattiin, ja jokaista osallistujaa haastateltiin erikseen joka pelikerran jälkeen. Pääsääntöisenä aineistona tutkimuksessa toimi tallennetut haastattelut pelikertojen jälkeen. Aineistosta oli tarkoituksena selvittää osallistujien näkemyksiä pöytäroolipelien soveltuvuudesta englannin oppimiseen ja niiden sisällyttämisestä perinteiseen luokkahuoneopetukseen. Aineisto analysoitiin pääsääntöisesti laadullisen sisällönanalyysin metodeilla. Tutkimuksen päätulokset osoittavat, että pöytäroolipelien pelaaminen englanniksi toimii hyvin englannin oppimisen keinona, johtuen etenkin kielenkäytön monipuolisuudesta ja pelaajien yhteistyöstä pelin aikana. Yllättävää oli kuitenkin, että osallistujat ilmaisivat pettymyksensä perinteiseen englannin luokkahuoneopetukseen Suomessa, johtuen etenkin vähäisestä improvisaation määrästä. Pöytäroolipelit voisivat paikata näitä puutteita, mutta etenkin nykyiset isot luokkahuonekoot ovat esteenä näiden pelien sujuvaan sisällyttämiseen. Johtuen pöytäroolipelien rajusta kasvusta, tulisi aihetta tutkia vielä suuremmilla osallistujamäärillä, jotta aiheesta saataisiin kattavampaa tutkimustietoa.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-06-30 19:37:20","","62","","","","","","","","","","University of Jyväskylä","Jyväskylä","en","Julkaisu on tekijänoikeussäännösten alainen.

This article brings an experience report about strategies involving the principals and themes of Role-Playing Games used for online classes of English aimed at Brazilian children around the ages of five to nine years old. Role-playing games (at times also spelled as roleplaying games; abbreviated to RPG or RPGs) are games in which the people participating in them (players) assume the roles of characters within a fictional setting. The idea of using RPG strategies to retain the attention of children while teaching from afar, via Zoom, Skype or any other platform that allows the direct interaction between educator and student comes from RPGs’ incredible capacity of transporting the mind of children to a different space, a space of attention and entertainment. As perceived by Tolomei (2017) and also shown in this experience report, motivation and engagement are enhanced through game mechanics.

This paper takes a look at the narrative differences within the two systems. More specifically investigate if Blades in the Dark is more playerdriven than Dungeons & Dragons. The two tested as closely as possible and will be compared with each other. This is a close reading on the rules and player agency rather than a one-on-one comparison. The comparisons were made regarding the mechanics and narrative differences within the systems rather than quality of the story. This study was conducted by running two sessions, one for each system, played by separate groups with the same game scenario and premise. Meaning that the background for both games, character and plot for the session were the same. Comparisons were made by observing player decisions, situations that arose and the influence that the gamemasters had on the game. It was found that there is a clear difference between the two systems, this difference regarding whether the players were reacting to the gamemaster, or the other way round. In Dungeons & Dragons, it was observed that the players reacted and acted according to what the gamemaster explained and played out, whereas in Blades in the Dark it appeared to be the opposite. Here we found that it was the Gamemaster who was reactive to the players instead. The paper concluded that Blades in the Dark is the more player-driven system. This short study could later be built upon and used by game developers to keep in mind and plan their future game systems around. Taking these observations on emergent narrative in Tabletop Role-playing Games into account can be used to create more player-centric and player-driven games. Meaning that the players are more in influence and decisions to make in the story and game.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 03:31:54","2021-07-08 20:02:52","","63","","","","","Emergent Player-Driven Narrative in Blades in the Dark and Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons","","","","","Uppsala Universitet","Uppsala","en","","BA Game design","","","www.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_group dynamics; _dnd; _narrative authority; _TTRPG; _pbta; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these concepts are often introduced to learners through compliance (i.e., we do this because we are required to or it is the right thing to do), and as a result can mean learning experiences around spatial data management are viewed less than enthusiastically. Academic libraries are places where engaging learning experiences around spatial data management can be explored and implemented through unique pedagogical techniques. For example, activities teaching spatial data management in academic libraries through a popular culture lens can make these topics more approachable and reduce learning barriers. In this paper, I present three lesson plans for academic librarians which approach teaching spatial data management through popular culture. The following concepts are represented: (1) understanding spatial metadata through Dungeons & Dragons; (2) learning to write good documentation through drawing Pokémon; and (3) developing good file naming habits with 1980s album covers. Alongside the lesson plans, I provide a narrative outlining why popular culture pedagogy is a useful technique to spatial data management education to increase the inclusivity and engagement around geospatial learning experiences in academic libraries.","2021-07-09","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-09 02:43:19","2021-07-13 20:25:44","239-253","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/15420353.2021.1944948 QID: Q114543428","","","","_information literacy; _dnd; _map; _curriculum; _data; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _LEARNING; _LIBRARY","popular culture; pedagogy; GIS data management; lesson plans; spatial data management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the variety of games available on the market today, it is imperative to consider each game genre separately for what it can offer to a particular class. This paper focuses on the genre of tabletop role-playing games and how the ELT classroom could profit from using their principles. The introduction of tabletop role playing games can positively impact on all four language skills, but the benefits stretch beyond this to sociolinguistic competence and promotion of a more relaxed atmosphere in the classroom. These positive aspects create a space which promotes learner-centeredness by motivating students to engage with the lesson through play. The paper also addresses the possible pitfalls of implementing tabletop role playing game principles and provides options for overcoming possible obstacles. Additionally, two observation studies are presented that show how the introduction of tabletop role-playing game principles can positively impact on the teaching and learning of English, one conducted in an after-school club and one in a class of university students of English. The former showcases how the environment shaped by tabletop role-playing games fosters the use of the target language. The latter provides us with insights into how students in an actual classroom respond to an activity which incorporates tabletop role-playing game principles. Both research studies support tabletop role playing games as positive additions to the arsenal of English language teaching activities.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-07-28 21:56:10","","101","","","","","","","","","","Univerza v Ljubljani","Ljubljana","en","","Master English","","","","","","","","","_language learning; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My research questions included: 1) how do players negotiate legibility (make sense) of their queer identities within the context of their experiences participating in tabletop roleplaying games; and 2) what do the experiences of queer TTRPG players reveal about the relationships between legibility, space, and play? Drawing from social organization theory (Butler, 2004) and ecological definitions (Ramadier & Moser, 1998), I positioned legibility as the extent to which individuals are able to make sense of themselves in relation to their social environments and I use spatial metaphors, such as Third Space and safe houses, to help define the relationship between identity, literacy, and legibility, and to consider the role of play in facilitating these interconnected and constructive processes. My findings demonstrated that legibility was interwoven into the potent and powerful moments of pleasure experienced by participants, which I referred to as the magic. Additionally, I established the intimate connection between the concept of space and player perceptions of the magic, demonstrating that pleasure is in the experience of “crossing-over.” Then, drawing on player accounts of these experiences, I identified five forces that constitute the magic, components that not only regulate the pleasure possible within the play space, but also maintain the threshold and bounds of the space. I also discussed what players did within the space, or in constructing the space, that can be understood as cultivating these vital ingredients of play and pleasure. In the discussion, I outlined a path and framework for how players experienced personal transformation through play experiences and demonstrated the importance of intentional reflection and integration of play experiences toward the lasting effects of the magic.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-08-02 15:44:36","","171","","","","","Making sense of the magic","","","","","The University of Texas at Austin","Austin, TX","en","","Ph.D. Educational Psychology","","","http://dx.doi.org/10.26153/tsw/13902","","Accepted: 2021-07-27T17:36:13Z DOI: 10.26153/tsw/13902","","","","_gender; _minority; _lgbtq; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","Identity; Queer; Tabletop roleplaying games; Legibility; Literacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many of the products available reveal a visible movement of popular fantasy worlds between different media. This transmedia process creates a strong link between film, merchandising and games; with all of these mediums borrowing from each other. This borrowing takes various forms, from licensed adaptations to unofficial copying of ideas, settings and characters as well as exploiting the different aesthetics and techniques of different media. Much of the scholarship on transmedia concentrates on storytelling, where a single overarching narrative unfolds over several different media. This thesis will move away from storytelling to consider how culture producers borrow the aesthetics, narratives and fantasy worlds from other sources, including computer games. This borrowing happens because it enables them to use transmedia functionality to gain market share from an already established audience who have a vested interested in, and enthusiasm for, an established world. Most of this borrowing happens around specific genres – especially fantasy, science fiction and horror. These genres are particularly wide-ranging and emphasise the possibilities of worldbuilding, making then good sources for multi-media franchises. This thesis will examine examples from these genres to examine what elements are translated to a new medium, and what is discarded. This examination will help explain how and why different media and settings work in the way that they do.","2013-05","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-08-10 15:39:27","","245","","","","","A World of Difference","","","","","University of East Anglia","","en","","Ph.D School of Film, Television and Media Studies","","","ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk","","","","","","_worldbuilding; _transmedia; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, the structure and intensity of the verbal communication between players in three different types of multiplayer role-playing games are analyzed. Data is drawn from a series of empirical experiments covering: A) Console gaming; B) Multiple players in a conventional LAN-setup, and: C) non-digital tabletop gaming. The results indicate that there are distinct differences in the overall communication pattern between the three game setups. When players share a single screen they communicate more than when each person has their own monitor, indicating a direct effect of the representation of the game medium on player communication. Additionally, in the digital games, speech intensity varies as a function of the game content: Players communicate the most during non-stressful game segments, and the least during intensive combat scenes, although the latter does require extensive coordination. The implication of this result is that analysis of player communication has the potential to be used as symptoms of boredom or excitement.","2008","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 03:31:36","","113–120","","","","","","","Future Play '08","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1496984.1497003","_personality; _group dynamics; _oral communication; _anxiety; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _empirical work; _computer rpg; _MEDIA; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the three dice all give the same result, another three dice are rolled and added to the total. This is continued until the three dice no longer match. We calculate the average result of the stochastic sum: 10 + 4/5.  We also consider a generalized dice rolling scheme where we roll an arbitrary number of dice with arbitrary number of sides. This generalization is motivated by various exotic dice that are used in many roleplaying games. We calculate the expectation, and how much it differs from the situation where we only roll the set of dice once, with no rerolling and adding. As the number of dice increases, or the number of sides the dice have increases, this difference approaches zero, unless there are two dice (with the number of sides increasing), in which case the difference approaches one.","2019","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","111-116","","","7","","Math.

In order to help gifted children and adolescents develop and practice social and emotional self-regulation skills, we investigated the use of an Adlerian play therapy approach during pen-and-paper roleplaying games. Additionally, we used Goffman’s (1961, 1974) social role identification and distance to encourage participants to experiment with new identities. Herein, we propose a psychosocial model of interactions during role-playing games based on Goffman's theory and Adlerian play therapy techniques, and suggest that role-playing games are an effective way of intervening with gifted children and adolescents to improve their intra- and interpersonal skills. We specifically targeted intrapersonal skills of exercising creativity, becoming self-aware, and setting individual goals by raising participants’ awareness of their privately logical reasons for making decisions and their levels of social interest. We also targeted their needs and means of seeking significance in the group to promote collaboration and interaction skills with other gifted peers through role analysis, embracement, and distancing. We report results from a case study and conclude that role-playing games deserve more attention, both from researchers and clinical practitioners, because they encourage change while improving young clients' social and emotional development.","2013","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-05 14:28:26","2021-08-11 19:19:34","173","","4","22","","","Using group role-playing games with gifted children and adolescents","","","","","","","en","","","","","psycnet.apa.org","","Publisher: US: Educational Publishing Foundation","","","","_therapy; _yo13-19; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; _soft skills; _yo1-12; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pen-and-paper role-playing games (P&P RPG) are a concept known since the early 1970s. Since then, the genre has attracted a massive community of players while branching out into several genres and P&P RPG systems to choose from. Due to the highly interactive and dynamic nature of the game, a participants individual impact on narrative and interactive aspects of the game is extremely high. The diversity of scenarios within this context unfold a variety of players needs, as well as factors limiting and enhancing game-play. Companion offers an audio management workspace for creation and playback of soundscapes based on visual layouting.

This new medium has allowed the playing of games to become a digestible, consumable text for individuals to watch, enjoy, learn from, and analyze. Bridging the gap between the analog and the digital, actual play is changing and challenging our expectations of tabletop role-playing and providing a space for new scholarship. This edited collection of essays focuses on Dungeons and Dragons actual play and examines this phenomenon from a variety of different disciplinary approaches. Authors explore how to define actual play, how fans interact with and affect the narrative and gameplay of actual play, the diversity of gamers (or lack thereof) within actual play media, and how audiences can use actual play media for more than mere entertainment.","2021-08-03","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","227","","","","","Watch Us Roll","","","","","McFarland","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: FxA8EAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=FxA8EAAAQBAJ","_actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, however, D&amp;D and other RPGs have emerged at the forefront of gaming culture. The allure of fantasy and magic draws players into creating and roleplaying characters in a mediated fantasy space through social interaction. Though largely untheorized, Dungeons &amp; Dragons has been examined through sociological and philosophical lenses, though these studies often ignore the performative aspects of the game itself.During gameplay, Dungeon Masters (DMs) often exploit sensory detail, music specifically, in order to encourage roleplay in their players. The fifth edition handbook of D&amp;D states that DMs can use “music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they might play in the game.” The following research explores the use of music within D&amp;D as it relates to the players’ ability to immerse themselves within the game, drawing on research in ludomusicology and applying a lens of reflexive and close ethnography. Additionally, this research explicates a growing popularity of D&amp;D on the internet through shows such as Critical Role and the live storytelling genre, as well as how it has altered ideas concerning the performance of voice. Based on interviews with players and observations of D&amp;D games in person and via online streaming services, this article asserts that music allows players to immerse themselves within the setting of the game, which in turn creates a form of participatory performance for both the players and the Dungeon Master.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-08-12 18:48:18","46-64","","1","2","","Journal of Sound and Music in Games","Dungeons, Dragons, and Music","","","","","","","en","","","","","Silverchair","","QID: Q114772223","","","","_immersion; _bleed; _theater; _dnd; _actual play; _music; _hospitality; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =rabbit; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _EMOTIONS; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With Rancière’s politics as a framework, this study works backward from Ian Bogost’s Persuasive Games (2007) to his Unit Operations (2006), and then to Alain Badiou’s Manifesto for Philosophy (1989), in order to recover the radical politics undergirding Bogost’s distinct method of game criticism. Badiou’s Manifesto, going beyond Bogost’s primary philosophical source, Badiou’s Being and Event (1988), clariﬁes the political stakes of Badiou’s ontology, allowing us to return to the present with a more robust politics of procedurality motivating our critical work. From here, Alder and Rosenbaum’s Dream Askew / Dream Apart (2018) furnishes us with a provocative model of emancipatory procedurality suited not only for radical play but radical design, challenging the limits of Bogost’s “persuasion” as an activist paradigm.","2021-08-05","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-08-30 17:02:57","","","","","","","No Dice, No Masters","","","","","Zenodo","","en","Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, Open Access","","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","","","","","_philosophy; _procedural storytelling; _theater; _mechanics; _narrative authority; _TTRPG; _belonging; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; =HOT; _EMOTIONS","Alain Badiou; Avery Alder; Belonging Outside Belonging; Benjamin Rosenbaum; Emancipation; Game Studies; Ian Bogost; Jacques Rancière; Procedures; Tabletop Roleplaying","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GENeration Analog: The Tabletop Games and Education Virtual Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the genres, role-playing games (RPGs) require special attention, and readers of this chapter should be familiar with the concept of role-playing. RPGs are interactive worlds where players assume the roles of fictional characters and determine their own actions based on the character they play. Players typically follow a storyline in a fictional world and interact with other player (PCs) or non-player characters (NPCs) to complete missions and achieve various goals. As the player completes quests and overcomes conflicts, his/her character advances in levels and becomes stronger. Tabletop fantasy RPGs have parallels to wargames and educational simulations, but they focus more on the role and player choices are virtually unlimited (Fine, 1983). The key difference between tabletop RPGs (or FRPs) and computer RPGs is that the video game is no longer a collectively produced fantasy and takes place within strictly defined parameters (Apperley, 2006).

"SBNF38X8","thesis","2021","Breen, Lorna","Making believe, together: a pilot study of the feasibility and potential therapeutic utility of a family tabletop role-playing game","","","","","https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/13358","Interventions for children and their families have traditionally stemmed from two interrelated frameworks: play-based child therapies, and family therapies (Gil, 2015). Integrated family play therapy frameworks aim to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches by combining meaningful engagement of children through play, and systems-level insights into patterns of family functioning and interaction (Gil, 2015). A virtually unexplored avenue for play-based therapeutic applications of role-play that may lend themselves to an integrated family play therapy framework are tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs); cooperative and narrative-based games wherein players adopt the role of fictional characters as they navigate a fantasy setting arbitrated by a game master. Case studies on the use of TRPGs with children and young adults have yielded initial evidence of their potential therapeutic utility (e.g., Blackmon, 1994; Enfield, 2007; Rosselet & Stauffer, 2013), however, research on their application is limited, particularly with families. The current study pilot tested an original TRPG module (“The Family Tabletop Adventure”) for use with families to establish the module’s potential therapeutic utility and identify targets for further refinement. A sample of three family groups (N = 11) were recruited to participate in six weekly online sessions (a 1-hour introductory session, four 1.5- to 2-hour game sessions, and a 1-hour exit interview). A variety of mixed-method measures were used to assess family functioning at baseline and post-game, including observational coding, self-report, and qualitative group interviews. Exploratory analyses of the findings indicated the module’s feasibility of implementation and ease of use, low iatrogenic risk, perceptions by families as fun and engaging, and potential utility across a range of family processes relevant to therapeutic contexts, including communication and problem solving, positive interactions and relationship building, and the generation of novel insights about family members. Family feedback was used to identify several targets for additional refinement of the game module to improve families’ comprehension and engagement with the game. The implications of these findings and their relevance to the use of TRPGs in family intervention contexts are discussed.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-09-07 13:08:15","","","","","","","Making believe, together","","","","","University of Victoria","Victoria","en","Available to the World Wide Web","Thesis","","","dspace.library.uvic.ca","","Accepted: 2021-09-01T19:21:40Z","","","","_therapy; _family; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly, drawing on the varied modes of reality offered by each of the above, and they ways they can support experimentation with alternative societies, relationships, and political ideologies.Beginning with a contextual analysis of Dungeons & Dragons, it outlines the structure, history, and current iterations of tabletop roleplaying games, towards an understanding of how the form can be used in the construction of playful, microcosmic utopias sensitive to queer experiences of solidarity within marginalisation. To illustrate this usage, Avery Alder’s queer, post-apocalyptic TRPG Dream Askew (2019) is later explored as a particularly appropriate case study to illustrate this usage.The paper goes on to look at how the conception of Utopia as a world apart (as in Thomas Moore’s ‘No Place’), the establishing of a ‘Magic Circle’ (coined by Johan Huizinga) as a zone of shifted possibility in both game and performance contexts, and the genres of science fiction and speculative fiction, can be used together to facilitate a form of collaborative storytelling. This type of storytelling is noted as being politically significant in the ways it consolidates the roles of performer and spectator, engaging with Augusto Boal’s critiques of passive spectatorship, and framing of performance as possible “rehearsal for revolution” [1974(2008): 135].","2020-11-16","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 01:51:30","2021-09-13 02:54:35","129-136","","8","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13528165.2020.1930786","","","","_lgbtq; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a queer theory framework, the authors consider how youth performed disidentifications and queer futurity. Design/methodology/approach This study is a discourse analysis of approximately 85 hours of audio collected over one year. Findings Youth engaged in deconstructive critique, disidentifications and queer futurity in powerful enactments of critical literacies that involved simultaneous resistance, subversion, imagination and hope as youth envisioned queer utopian world-building through their fantasy storytelling. Youth acknowledged the injustice of the present while radically envisioning a utopian future. Originality/value This study offers an empirical grounding for critical literacies centered in queer theory and explores how youth engage with critical literacies in collaboratively co-authored texts.

When Dungeons & Dragons was first released to a small hobby community, it hardly seemed destined for mainstream success—and yet this arcane tabletop role-playing game became an unlikely pop culture phenomenon. In Game Wizards, Jon Peterson chronicles the rise of Dungeons & Dragons from hobbyist pastime to mass-market sensation, from the initial collaboration to the later feud of its creators, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. As the game's fiftieth anniversary approaches, Peterson—a noted authority on role-playing games—explains how D&D and its creators navigated their successes, setbacks, and controversies. Peterson describes Gygax and Arneson's first meeting and their work toward the 1974 release of the game; the founding of TSR and its growth as a company; and Arneson's acrimonious departure and subsequent challenges to TSR. He recounts the “Satanic Panic” accusations that D&D was sacrilegious and dangerous, and how they made the game famous. And he chronicles TSR's reckless expansion and near-fatal corporate infighting, which culminated with the company in debt and overextended and the end of Gygax's losing battle to retain control over TSR and D&D. With Game Wizards, Peterson restores historical particulars long obscured by competing narratives spun by the one-time partners. That record amply demonstrates how the turbulent experience of creating something as momentous as Dungeons & Dragons can make people remember things a bit differently from the way they actually happened.","2021-10-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-05 20:35:23","","","400","","","","","Game Wizards","Game Histories","","","","MIT Press","Cambridge, MA","en","","","","","MIT Press Books","","QID: Q114426544","","","","_dnd; _arneson; _gygax; _cease&desist; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _proto-history of rpg; _law studies; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, even though many new games appear every year, TRPGs still does not occupy a dominant position in the game market. Most gamers prefer video games and board games to TRPG. The aim of this project is to use qualitative analysis to investigate which parts of TRPG design prohibit players from engaging with TRPGs and then to create a novel TRPG that addresses these design problems. This project will combine newly formulated design elements into a game designed to attract new players and ensure that player engagement is sustained in subsequent play. The project focuses on the example of China, where many people play video games and board games, but few know about or play TRPGs. Therefore, this research will mainly study the gaming behaviour and feedback of Chinese participants to study what methods can attract Chinese players to TRPGs.","2021-09-14","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-09-20 16:08:33","","69","","","","","","","","","","Victoria University of Wellington - Te Herenga Waka","Wellington","en","","Master of Design Innovation","","","openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz","","DOI: 10.26686/wgtn.16614010.v1","","","","_mechanics; _new player; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What this changed environment means in terms of satisfying our social needs is not fully understood. To explore this question, I followed a group of Pathfinder Roleplaying Game players as they navigated adjusting their formerly in-person weekly game sessions to a virtual environment. While using a virtual tabletop platform for visual collaboration and a voice chat program to speak with one another allowed the players to hold sessions and didn’t appear to restrict their creative engagement with the game, the restrictions of the virtual environment inhibited social interaction and in one case worsened social anxiety for the players. This suggests that if we want to sustain online collaborative work in the future, we may need to reevaluate our virtual communication methods to better facilitate group-strengthening interactions.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:18","","","70","","","","","","","","","","University of Maryland","Baltimore","en","","MA, English Language and Literature/Letters","ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global","2572599225","","","ISBN: 9798535597423 Publication Title: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses 28317599","","","","_creativity; _literature; _oral communication; _embodiment; _anxiety; _TTRPG; _covid19; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _stem; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _DESIGN; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, the continued lack of inclusive design principles result in a lack of understanding of both neurodivergent culture, and the needs of the neurodivergent community. This study actively includes neurodivergent people by using participatory research methodology, and inclusive design principles and pedagogy explored in Critical Disability Studies and Critical Autism Studies. The continued pathologizing of neurodiverse conditions influences how medical systems treat neurodivergent people; Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) is the standard therapeutic treatment for autistic people. The focus of ABA and comparable treatments is to condition neurodivergent people to appear neurotypical, putting the onus on the neurodivergent community to change their behaviours instead of emphasizing acceptance and tolerance of neurodivergent people and behaviours. The statements and lived experiences of neurodivergent people who have experienced ABA showcases that it is not neurodivergent people that benefit from ABA and similar therapies, but neurotypical society that benefits from conditioning and changing the behaviours of neurodivergent folks (even if it may be at the expense of mental health and well-being). Neurodivergent self-advocacy groups, and Critical Autism scholars have expressed the need for therapies which build and encourage self-advocacy. Neurodiversity research focuses on conformity, so the unique abilities and culture of neurodivergent people is under researched. Role-play is an effective learning tool often used in therapy to help people practice skills in a low-risk environment. Role-play also is a core activity in Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRGPs) like Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) which allow players to explore and practice different identities and behaviours in a structured environment with more explicit rules than every day social interactions. D&D replicates the social constructs of the real world, but does not have neurodivergence or disability as an explicit social construct in its lore. I interviewed 5 self-identifying neurodivergent adults about their lived experience, held a co-design session, and observed 15 hours of their gameplay with custom designed neurodivergent mechanics with both strengths and weaknesses. We examined the gaps in structure and consent in the core D&D rules; the official rulebooks lack guidelines about boundary setting, consent, and facilitation for Dungeon Masters and players. Characters’ neurodivergent mechanics allowed players to more explicitly model their experience in the groups’ co-created D&D world. This was possible because we used different TTRPG safety tools to establish boundaries which establish psychological safety that is not typically available to neurodivergent folks in everyday life. The experiences of players and their characters bled into one another. This caused players to experience positive shifts in self-esteem, and practice transferable self-autonomy skills for potential out-of-game, real life self-advocacy and liberation.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-09 02:54:29","","","96","","","","","","","","","","The Ontario College of Art and Design University","Toronto","en","","Master of Design in Inclusive Design","","","Zotero","","","","","","_therapy; _autism; _dnd; _canada; _well-being; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _empirical work; _PSYCHOLOGY; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis will attempt to approach the tabletop role-playing game in a novel way through the context of adaptation studies.

This paper explores the reported challenges and benefits of playing D&amp;D through teleconferencing hardware and software, and the experience of using virtual tabletops. A thematic analysis of a sample of Reddit threads discussing player experiences of transitioning D&amp;D to remote play during COVID-19 social distancing was undertaken. The findings highlight a variety of player attitudes and preferences towards playing D&amp;D remotely. The data suggest a mostly negative sentiment towards playing D&amp;D online for groups that had transitioned from in-person to remote play. Loss of in-person socialisation was identified as an important contributor to a poor play experience, but groups would persevere with remote play to maintain social relationships, suggesting that, for many players, D&amp;D serves an important social function beyond mere play. Some avenues for future research are identified.","2021-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-03-14 13:48:24","2021-10-12 13:12:28","125","","4","11","","","From Tabletop to Screen","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute QID: Q114785010","","","","_virtual table; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _covid19; =0.33; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also identified four categories of traces: environment, build, memory and object. We introduce Play Traces, a novel analysis method for representing and co-designing with players and their narratives. A structured observation including Play Traces studied 17 players over 16 four-hour sessions in the third VTTRPG prototype. We found that players successfully (and enjoyably) co-designed novel narratives. We identified three themes for how traces can affect and support players in shaping new interactive narratives. We present four design implications describing how player-created narratives in MMORPGs should first Reveal & Pull Attention from other players, Invite & Push further exploration, Guide & Assist toward endings, and optionally Show & Hide traces. Finally, we discuss how treating players as co-designers offers a promising approach for developing the next generation of MMORPGs.","2021-10-06","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 17:02:20","2021-10-12 13:12:56","273:1–273:26","","","5","","","Co-Designers Not Troublemakers","","","","","","","","","","","","September 2021","","","","","","_creativity; _virtual table; _group dynamics; _collaborative; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, the use of oral storytelling and the use of folkloric artifacts within this podcast genre become key insights into how the queer community creates and performs its identity, connects its members into a cohesive community, and transmits its cultural information to both members and others. The ability of these podcasts to achieve this include how the storyteller/audience relationship is created — an extension of the oral folktale genre. In effect, the stories told by these podcasts are a key part of expressing queer identity and exploring the ways it is performed in several variations: the folk artifacts that communicate gender and sexuality, the performances of characters by their respective players, and the narrative structures created by the gaming systems themselves. To explore these elements, I examine Fast Times at D&D High, a podcast that features a diverse cast of players — both in terms of gender identity and sexualities, as well as race — and explores the early stages of identity creation through a group of high school teens navigating their world of magic and their queerness.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2021-10-18 20:10:25","","195","","","","","“To Become Who You Wish to Be”","","","","","Indiana State University","Terre Haute","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","MA English","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798535551593","","","","_actual play; _lgbtq; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _MEDIA","Storytelling; Identity; Roleplaying games; Folklore; Performativity; Podcasts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artwork in the D&D community has shaped and continues to shape how players understand aspects of the game, primarily because the game is one of pure imagination. This particular piece, for example, depicts an efreet, which is described as a giant djinn from the fire plane. Having a visual image allows players to better understand what the creators of D&D intend the monsters to actually be like. Examining the visual rhetoric of this image reveals the ideology held and perpetuated by the original writers of the game and presumably adopted by original players. The Dungeon Master's Guide is one of the core rule books of D&D, meaning that the book is required to play the game. The pervasiveness of this image in the D&D community and its position in D&D's history makes it an ideal visual text for rhetorical criticism. In the first section of this critique, I review literature about visual rhetoric and gendered images, and I introduce Sonja K. Foss's (1994) schema for evaluating visual imagery. In the second section, I describe the visual elements of the text. In the third section, using Foss's schema, I argue that the cover art of The Dungeon Master's Guide first functions to spark the imagination of its viewers and, second, functions to invite viewers to play D&D. These functions are only partially supported due to the exaggerated depiction of gender and race in the image, meaning that the image is centered on the hegemonic ideals of heterosexual, white males and is not invitational toward women or racial minorities. Finally, I conclude by articulating the implications of my argument.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-17 21:21:15","2021-10-20 14:45:16","223-255","","2","43","","","Dungeons & Dragons and Damsels in Distress","","","","","","","en","Copyright Organization for the Study of Communication Language and Gender Fall 2020","","","","ProQuest","","Num Pages: 223 Place: Urbana, United States Publisher: Organization for the Study of Communication Language and Gender","","","","_dnd; _gender; _minority; _anxiety; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","Play; Race; Imagination; Rhetoric; Hegemony; Heterosexuality; Imagery; Linguistics; Literature reviews; Psychological distress; Text structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Filling a game with facts and figures is no guarantee the game will help students learn – and generally makes for a bad game to boot. On the other hand, players have an immense capacity to engage with the content of games, often learning about the material on their own time and with far more depth of engagement than they demonstrate in school. The role-playing game Ars Magica contains factual and literal historical material – yet rather than turn the game into academic work, as many explicitly educational games do, it turns history into part of the game. How does Ars Magica achieve this? How does it avoid the “problem of content?” And how do specific groups using the game negotiate that historical content and incorporate it into play? Through analysis of game observations and in-depth, semi-structured interviews, this paper examines the texts, practices and technologies of an Ars Magica group in which players have successfully developed and deployed historical literacies. Players voluntarily engage in historical thinking, reading and research, including both online and offline activities. Additionally, the group has developed an idiosyncratic but historically grounded approach to thirteenth century thinking and behavior, which they attempt to simulate in play.","2012","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","21","","","","","","","","","","","MSU","East Lansing, MI","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_history; _TTRPG; _benefits of rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, they should monitor the physical environment at home for elements beneficial or detrimental to health. Difficulties are observed in nursing students to be able to mentally stage the different theoretical clinical cases, being the nurse home visit one of these situations that covers this problem. The main objective is to improve nursing students' knowledge, skills and attitudes about nurse home visit using clinical cases with tabletop role-playing game mechanics.  The specific objectives are the following:  (1) to assess the usefulness and playable experience through the aforementioned mechanics in this context,  (2) to evaluate the students' performance based on the role played in the clinical case through the virtual tabletop role-playing game. Methods: The teaching methodologies used were gamification and case-based learning. In the days prior to the simulation of three virtual clinical cases, 3-4 nursing students were assigned as family members and patients for each one, sending them their corresponding house plan (produced using the Sweet Home 3D software) and a genogram of the family. For virtual simulation, Google Meet was used with Google Meet Dice Roller extension, allowing random events or factors to be added to the clinical cases by means of a virtual ten-sided dice (1: worst event, 10: best event). In each clinical case, a student volunteered to act as a nurse in the case, at which time the patient's clinical history was provided. Once prepared, the story of each clinical case was developed from the street of the patient's home until the end of the nurse home visit, with a maximum duration of 30 minutes. Teachers acted as game masters. A pre-test questionnaire of nursing home visit was distributed. At the end of the simulation, participants completed the GAMEX scale, while the assistants evaluated the organisational, communicative and improvisational skills of the student who acted as nurse. All students completed a post-test knowledge questionnaire together with items related to their role. Results: Prior to the simulation, 66.7% (32) of the nursing students were familiar with role-playing games and 37.5% (18) had previously played tabletop role-playing games. Participants highlighted that the tabletop role-playing game mechanics were very useful for the development of the virtual clinical cases (9.23 +- 1.14 points), highlighting high scores on positive emotions and low scores on negative emotions about their gaming experience. Attendees felt that the students who acted as nurses did not plan the nurse home visit well and sometimes did not pay attention to the physical aspects of the home. However, after the simulation, knowledge of the most important phase of the nurse home visit (planning) was significantly improved (Z=-3; p=0.003). Conclusions: The use of tabletop role-playing game mechanics in the simulation of virtual clinical cases has been positive for the improvement of some knowledge and skills about nurse home visit in nursing students. The gaming experience was rewarding for the participants, while the attendees were able to detect and observe the difficulties of nursing in the home environment.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-10-28 16:04:38","11411-11416","","","","","","","","","","","IATED","Online","en","","","","","library.iated.org","","Conference Name: 13th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies Meeting Name: 13th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies Place: Online Conference","","","","_TTRPG; _medecine-nursing; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"HR9XF265","thesis","2021","Nascimento Ferreira, Lucas","Controlling Neural Language Models for Affective Music Composition","","","","","https://escholarship.org/uc/item/437430f4","Deep generative models are currently the leading method for algorithmic music composition. However, one of the major problems of this method consists of controlling the trained models to generate compositions with given characteristics. This dissertation explores how to control deep generative models to compose music with a target emotion. Given the limitation of labeled data, this dissertation focuses on search-based methods that use a music emotion classifier to steer the distribution of a pre-trained musical language model. Three different search-based approaches have been proposed. The first one is a genetic algorithm to optimize a language model towards a given sentiment. The second one is a decoding algorithm, called Stochastic Bi-Objective Beam Search (SBBS), which controls the language model at generation time. The third method is also a decoding algorithm but based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. SBBS has been applied to generate background music for tabletop roleplaying games, matching the emotion of the story being told by the players. A dataset of symbolic piano music called VGMIDI has been created to support the work in this dissertation. VGMIDI currently has 200 pieces labeled according to the circumplex model of emotion, and an additional 3,640 unlabelled pieces. The three methods were evaluated with listening tests, in which human subjects indicated that the methods could convey different target emotions.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-10-28 16:09:09","","","","","","","","","","","","UC Santa Cruz","","en","","","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","_music; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cette communication présente les résultats de la 2ème étape d'un travail de recherche débuté en 2018 qui consiste en l'intégration de JdR en cours d'anglais dans des classes constituées et non volontaires. Pour ce faire, nous avons poursuivi nos évaluations en nous intéressant au niveau 1 et à trois items du niveau 2 du modèle de Kirkpatrick (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). De plus, nous nous sommes interrogés sur la pédagogie actionnelle présentée par le cadre européen commun de référence pour les langues (CECRL, 2001). Ce travail est le cœur de notre communication. Notre problématique est donc la suivante : en quoi le jeu de rôle sur table peut-il favoriser la mise en oeuvre de la pédagogie actionnelle ? Après sept séances réalisées avec deux groupes de Licence Économie et Gestion, les résultats du questionnaire et nos observations sont particulièrement positifs : les étudiant·e·s sont pleinement engagé·e·s dans cette activité et la parole est libérée. Nous avons pu par conséquent établir des liens pertinents entre cette pratique ludopédagogique innovante dans sa forme et la mise en oeuvre de la pédagogie actionnelle s'appuyant, comme le JdR sur table, sur des situations authentiques scénarisées.","2020-05-14","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-11-02 14:18:18","","","","","","","Enseigner l’anglais grâce aux jeux de rôle sur table","","","","Post-Print","HAL","","en","","","","","ideas.repec.org","","Publication Title: Post-Print","","","","_language learning; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","anglais; CECRL; ludopédagogie; pédagogie actionnelle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","hal-02563070","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesize that a multi-task model that trains on character dialogue plus character relationship information improves transformer-based story continuation. To this end, we extend the Critical Role Dungeons and Dragons Dataset (Rameshkumar and Bailey, 2020) -- consisting of dialogue transcripts of people collaboratively telling a story while playing the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons -- with automatically extracted relationships between each pair of interacting characters as well as their personas.

At the same time, the rule frameworks that structure play work to create experimental and pedagogical environments where suppositions about reality can become true within the virtual play-space, and thus allow space for speculative performances of said reality; if the rules say that something is true, what then becomes true by extension? The combination of these elements allows for the construction of ‘dramaturgies of being,’ which facilitate the performance of identity within the speculative framework, and thus the testing of said identities.

This research paper examines the process of transmedia adaptation through the case study of Shakespeare’s The Tempest adapted into a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) module. The Tempest is remediated as an interactive game based on Wizards of the Coast’s Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition ruleset, designed to be facilitated by a Dungeon Master and played by a group of three to five players. The process of remediating The Tempest takes the play’s setting, characters, narrative conflict, and dialogue and translates them into the formal structure of the TTRPG, prompting questions that have long been asked in adaptation studies: how important is fidelity to the source text? What is lost, gained, and changed in transmedia translation?

Through this focus, the chapter intentionally draws parallels between informal gaming settings and classroom-based interactions.SettingThough this study makes specific connections to classroom pedagogies, data were collected from a multiyear ethnographic study of playing tabletop role-playing games with adult participants in informal learning environments. Data were collected from within public gaming cafes and shops.Research DesignParticipant observation within a role-playing game community served as the primary approach to this ethnographic study. In addition to fieldnote-based observation, interviews with players and archival analysis of gaming artifacts helped triangulate meaning-making at the gaming table. Analysis was conducted through an inductive coding approach that focused on player interactions, systems, and settings.FindingsCultural values, including racism and sexism, shaped player experiences at the table, based on systemic designs and textual guidance from game-related fiction. While games speak to broad possibilities for exploring race and gender, these constructs become limited through the layers of player beliefs, designed rule sets, and depictions within narratives. The emancipatory possibilities of ludic imagination are flattened by cultural norms that may oppress.ConclusionsBroadening the findings from this study, this chapter concludes with classroom-based recommendations. If a contemporary approach to critical pedagogy depends on dialogue and cultural understanding, this chapter points to the limitations of confining such work to traditional classroom settings. Instead, it suggests that an interrogation of these systems, alongside youth, is a necessary step in critically oriented classrooms.","2021-04-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-12-13 14:30:25","1-26","","13","123","","Teachers College Record","Chapter 1","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications","","","","_gender; _minority; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this task, the participants have to decide which two of four rotated figures match the target figure. The dependent measures were performance speed and accuracy. In our exploratory investigation, we further examined midline frontal theta band activation, parietal alpha band activation, and parietal alpha band asymmetry in EEG as indicator for the chosen rotation strategy. Additionally, we explored the gender influence on performance and EEG activation, although a very small female sample section was given. The expected gender difference concerning performance accuracy was negated by expertise in pen and paper role-playing women, while the gender-specific difference in performance speed was preserved. Moreover, gender differences concerning electro-cortical measures revealed differences in rotation strategy, with women using top-down strategies compared to men, who were using top-down strategies and active inhibition of associative cortical areas. These strategy uses were further moderated by expertise, with higher expertise leading to more pronounced activation patters, especially during successful performance. However, due to the very limited sample size, the findings of this explorative study have to be interpreted cautiously.","2021-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-03-14 13:49:22","2021-12-13 14:33:30","2337","","12","13","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 12 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","_gender; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _neuroscience; =0.33; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In his 2015 book, Dangerous Games: What theMoral Panic over Role-Playing Games says about Play, Religion,and Imagined Worlds, David Laycock explores why fantasy roleplayinggames seem similar enough to religion to provoke fear,as well as the dynamics of this moral panic. While he, apparently,did not set out to write a book about Islam, his insights about religion,fantasy, and narrative opened my eyes to the dynamics oftwentieth-century Islam. Additionally, as a Muslim reader livingduring a “moral panic” over Islam, Laycock’s analysis helped meunderstand that today’s Islamophobia in America has little to dowith Islam. Lastly, although Muslim gamers, fantasy/sciencefictionauthors, and game developers are usually underacknowledged,there is increasing interest in Muslims and fantasy/science-fiction. I hope to call attention to this invisible cohort.","2016-07-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2021-12-13 16:57:42","138-149","","3","33","","AJIS","A Muslim Reflection on Dangerous Games","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2016 International Institute of Islamic Thought","","","","www.ajis.org","","Number: 3","","","","_moral panic; _religion; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Prior study of gaming and the act of play prove that the space is inherentlysocial. However, we speculate that, through metadiscourse, the social aspect of the tabletop role-playing game is central to group cohesion and perpetuation of the gaming subculture. Metadiscourse involves conversation not linked to the current game but could be cordial and relational, critical, or completely unrelated to the game. However, it is an informal conversation that would not occur if there was no game. In metadiscourse there are determinations of gaming capital, or elements of value. Participation in metadiscourse allows an individual to feel included in the game and gaming subculture. However, metadiscourse demonstrates a level of gaming capital through situatedness and affordances that can act as a gatekeeping function for individuals.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-03-18 18:28:28","2022-01-02 19:28:27","96-107","","2","4","","","“Table Talk”","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.ceeol.com","","Publisher: Univerzita sv.

Though there has been some interest in sociological and ethnographic research in the broader realm of role-playing games as a whole, minimal research exists specifically examining the therapeutic applications of tabletop role-playing games (e.g., Dungeons & Dragons). The purpose of this capstone is to examine the limited existing research on therapeutic applications of tabletop role-playing games, to ground the use of this intervention in other, well-established modalities, and to make links with related areas of research such as in education and learning and the field of simulation training. Further, this paper seeks to understand reasons why therapeutically applied tabletop role-playing games remain widely under-researched in academia, and to identify possible barriers to access. The final purpose of this paper is to discuss ways to lower and eliminate barriers to access, as well as to suggest a possible outreach program to educate adult gatekeepers for youth engagement in therapeutically applied tabletop role-playing game programs, as improving social skills in youth has been demonstrated to be a positive outcome of this intervention.","2021-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:14:49","2022-01-02 19:30:34","","85","","","","","","","","","","City University of Seattle","Vancouver, BC, Canada Site","en","Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 United States","Master of Counselling","","","repository.cityu.edu","","Accepted: 2021-12-23T23:51:28Z Publisher: City University of Seattle","","","","_therapy; _canada; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fiasco is a TRPG that utilizes prompts inspired by genre fiction to collaboratively generate, establish, and resolve scenes between a varied cast of characters in several rounds improvisational roleplay. To explore the range of literacy experience opportunities, present in its play, we present our experiences designing and playing a Fiasco session and reflect upon the transformative potential of tabletop games in creating literacy experiences. The position we undertake, in favor of the considered use of TRPGs for learning through serious gaming in classrooms, is reflective of the experiences within our local gaming and learning communities. Based upon this experience and relevant literature, we contend that table-top gaming fits well within literacy pedagogy and explore how they can be used in classrooms. Therefore, our discussion is centered upon the potential of tabletop games experiences to be considered inventive, specifically in relation to the teaching and learning of literacy skills within a serious gaming framework.","2021-12-24","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-01-02 19:31:24","98-105","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2021 Canadian Journal for New Scholars in Education/ Revue canadienne des jeunes chercheures et chercheurs en éducation","","","","journalhosting.ucalgary.ca","","Number: 2","","","","_literature; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this analysis is to criticize how there is a lack of modern-day adult male figures to look up to in the US. In this alternate male role model, which the game presents, the characters can develop a masculine gender performance, in contexts that have absent parental figures. In analyzing these texts, I utilize a focus on gender studies, with a combination of class theory from the works of Marx and Foucault and Borderlands theory from the work of Anzaldua. Each text provides characters who must face obstacles, related to these theoretical approaches, and the project focuses on how they must face these without a male role model to guide them. The tabletop role playing game provides a fantasy space that allows for the  adolescent boys in these two texts, to experience heroic action, and have a model to become men.","2021-12-09","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-01-02 19:34:16","","","","","","","","","","","","Universidad de Puerto Rico","Puerto Rico","en","(c) Luis E.

For example, teachers might simulate different scenarios, and role-play different stakeholders and users, in order to create more experiential types of learning environments. Role-playing can also provide an opportunity for students to actively explore, reflect upon and personalise the material that is studied. Similar techniques can be seen in User Experience Design (UXD), where practitioners create personas and scenarios to describe representative and typical users and use-cases. In this report, we propose an alternative use to the more traditional way of using personas and scenarios in academia as well as in industry: as character sheets and role-playing. Instead of being more analytical and descriptive tools in the design process, our role-playing approach invites exploration and personal interaction. Putting such character sheets into action allows the design team to interact with hypothetical, but typical users, thus providing a richer understanding of their context, and facilitating an empathetic understanding of the different stakeholders and their sometimes conflicting interests. This is particularly relevant in an educational context, where students are learning and training to improve as designers.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-01-04 01:03:13","","","15","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_gamification; _character sheet; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although such decisions may be subjective, little data has been produced to inform the debate regarding how critical an issue this is. In particular, does consuming such material relate to racism in the real world, or do a majority of individuals, particularly people of color, consider such depictions racist? The current study sought to address these issues in a sample of 308 adults (38.2% non-White) a subset of whom (17%) were players of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. Playing Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) was not associated with greater ethnocentrism (one facet of racism) attitudes. Only 10.2% found a depiction of orc monsters as inherently evil to be offensive. However, when later asked the blunter question of whether the same depiction was racist, the number jumped to 34.0%, with women particularly inclined to endorse this position. This suggests asking people about racism may prime them to see racism in material they hadn’t previously found to be offensive. Neither participant race nor history playing the D&D game was associated with perceptions of offensiveness or racism.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-02-21 18:48:52","2022-01-05 01:56:21","","","","11","","Curr Psychol","Are orcs racist?","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","QID: Q114741503","","","","_major publication; _moral panic; _minority; _anxiety; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to assess the impact of this game on participants’ thoughts of who might be affected by a flood event, two questionnaires were used, one before and one after the game. The results show that there was very positive feedback from the participants on how this RPG helped them realize the different implications a flood event might have on citizens and decision makers.

These works separate the individual benefits from the social benefits, overlooking symbolic interactionist insights into social life. As Fine (1983) describes in his seminal work on the “shared fantasy” of table-top role-playing gamers, social play is tantamount to gamers’ leisure activities. To build on more recent leisure research that establishes the importance of social gaming, we explore the social dynamics of video and table-top gamers’ leisure and its impact on their relationships. Using interview and ethnographic data from two independent studies, we examine three emergent gaming processes: gamers’ focus on social play, developing social skills, and passing games up/down to relatives and friends. Overall, this work draws attention to how gamers engage in social play, a direct contrast to gamer stereotypes still held by many non-gamers.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:05:09","2022-02-22 16:11:02","1-20","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/01490400.2022.2036274","","","","_fandom; _group dynamics; _anthropology; _oral communication; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _play with kids; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work; _soft skills; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With that in mind, this paper explores a proposal to motivate students’ L2 oral communication through the practice of narrative games called tabletop roleplaying games adapted as task-based activities. It implied an action research process in which the teacher-researcher with his students reflected and intervened on the identified problematic situation: Lack of oral communication in L2. In that sense, it started with a diagnostic test that showed the current state of verbal communication in L2 in a Colombian rural public school. Next, the teacher-researcher chose to appeal to the gamification of the classroom along with the adoption of a task-based framework to activity design aiming to improve students’ motivation to take the risk of communicating in L2. The teacher-researcher applied sets of activities that progressed from traditional role-play to a tabletop roleplaying game. In accordance, video recordings, narratives, artifacts collections, and semi-structured interviews were essential to collect data. Afterward, the teacher-researcher analyzed the data with an emic approach to identify patterns in the information that uncovered the categories and subcategories of information. Consequently, the teacher-researcher concluded that the students feel better motivated using L2 if the learning environment offers opportunities for social interaction, collaborative work, and scaffolding in task-based exercises embedded in a fictional world game.","2022-02-06","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-11-09 14:36:14","2022-03-01 15:51:40","105-128","","1","29","","","Speaking in Worlds of Adventure","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2022 Fabio Adrian Torres Rodriguez, Liliana  Martínez-Granada","","","","www.howjournalcolombia.org","","QID: Q110930273","","","","_language learning; _motivation; _oral communication; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; =PM; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe imaginative play in adults via the term “pretensive shared reality;” Shared Pretensive Reality describes the ability of a group of individuals to employ a range of higher-order cognitive functions to explicitly and implicitly share representations of a bounded fictional reality in predictable and coherent ways, such that this constructed reality may be explored and invented/embellished with shared intentionality in an ad hoc manner. Pretensive Shared Reality facilitates multiple individual and social outcomes, including generating personal and group-level enjoyment or mirth, the creation or maintenance of social groups, or the safe exploration of individual self-concepts (such as alternative expression of a players sexual or gender identity). Importantly, Pretensive Shared Reality (both within the specific context of table-top role-playing games, and other instances) are primarily co-operative and co-creative. We draw on multiple examples, and focus on Table-Top Role Playing games (TTRPG) – and specifically, the most popular and enduring table-top role-playing games, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) – as a primary example of such play. Our conception of “pretensive shared reality” links the widespread existence and forms of adult imaginative play to childhood pretense, places it within a developmental and evolutionary context, and argues that pretensive shared realities – which underpin many forms of imaginative culture – are an important topic of study unto themselves, and may be utilized to provide methodological insight into a variety of psychological domains.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 17:08:38","2022-03-01 16:41:02","","","774085","13","","","Pretensive Shared Reality","","","","","","","en","","","","","Frontiers","","QID: Q114772230","","","","_major publication; _pretend play; _bleed; _dnd; _collaborative; _religion; _embodiment; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _cultural transmission; =0.33; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through the analysis of a game corpus, we aim at understanding the mediatisation process of historical knowledge (the translation of history into a medium) in a game-related perspective. Firstly, we consider the historiographical dimension of history. Historians’ reflections on their discipline, but also works on history as a genre, clearly show that the relation between historical knowledge and fiction/narrative is ambiguous. Secondly, we focus on the theoretical tools that may help us to find a connection between history’s seriousness and game’s triviality. As the approach and use of historical knowledge by a game-related medium are not involved with formal and pedagogic learning processes, we confront them to other theoretical tools such as studies about informal learning and the notions of knowledge circulation. Thirdly, we concentrate on the presentation of our research object: roleplaying game. Roleplaying game, which is an ambivalent field as well as a medium whose distribution is limited within networks of the mass gaming culture, has distinctive features such as the completeness and coherence of its imaginary worlds. The last part of our work aims at analysing these features and their relation to the mediatisation of historical knowledge by roleplaying games. The construction of fictional worlds “recycling” history and the setting up of game mechanisms reflecting play uses of historical resource appear as the two major elements driving the transformation process of historical knowledge into ludic knowledge. Finally, history mediatisation within roleplaying games should not be confronted to criteria of historical validity but should be considered as an appropriation process of knowledge via game-related fiction.","2010-12","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-02-16 16:10:58","","","","","","","Du savoir historique au savoir ludique","","","","","Université Paris 13","Paris","fr","","Thèse pour le doctorat en sciences de l’éducation","","","HAL Archives Ouvertes","","","","","","_history; _france; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","sciences du jeu; histoire; simulation; corpus; culture ludique; éducation informelle; game study; gaming culture; historical knowledge; history; informal learning; jeu de rôles; knowledge circulation; mediatisation; mobilité des savoirs; roleplaying games; savoirs historiques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study draws on a thematic analysis of qualitative data (N = 201) collected in April 2020, which is explored through the lens of Apperley’s (2010) theory of gaming rhythms. The results illuminate the ways in which gaming was situated in everyday life both during and before the COVID-19 restrictions, and how the pandemic and its associated restrictions disrupted, reinforced, and reconﬁgured the everyday rhythms of gaming. The situation impacted individuals and families differently, being beneﬁcial to some and detrimental to others, contingent on other aspects of respondents’ lives. The results underline how an individual’s gaming does not happen in isolation, but takes place in the conﬁnes of everyday life, shaped by factors outside the individual’s control. Developing Apperley’s theory, the results show that gaming can be a very resilient activity, given the right circumstances.","2022-03-02","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-03-04 21:35:33","1-20","","0","0","","Convergence","Pandemic rhythms","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","QID: Q114008019","","","","_mental disorder; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _covid19; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its applications and effects on human behavior and mental health are, however, still an underexplored area.MethodsA scoping review was performed on the literature about RPGs as a therapeutic tool or prevention strategy in psychotherapies and mental health, highlighting studies? populations, forms of RPG and interventions used. To that, a systematic search in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, BVS/LILACS databases and grey literature was performed.ResultsOf the 4,069 studies reviewed, 50 sources of evidence were included. The majority was published as of 2011 (78%) in journals (62%) and targeted therapeutic uses of RPGs (84%). Most interventions used computer (50%) or tabletop RPGs (44%), mostly with cognitive and/or behavioral (52%) therapeutical approaches and targeting adolescents (70%).ConclusionThe findings suggest a potential use of RPGs as a complementary tool in psychotherapies. However, only 16% of the studies included were experimental. We identified considerable heterogeneity in RPGs definitions, outcomes and interventions used, preventing a systematic review. Thus, more empirical and well-designed studies on the application of RPGs in mental health are needed.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-03-07 20:07:37","285-311","","3","53","","Simulation & Gaming","Therapeutic Use of Role-Playing Game (RPG) in Mental Health","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","_therapy; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _literature review; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY","games; role-playing games; mental health; prevention; psychotherapy; scoping review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Talsorian Games (RTG). His instrumental role in creating Cyberpunk (1988), among other tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) cannot be overstated. Cyberpunk helped establish the aesthetic and mechanical basis for all future cyberpunk game franchises, including Shadowrun (1989–), Deus Ex (2000–), SLA Industries (1993), and Invisible, Inc. (2015). Cyberpunk 2020 (1990), the best-known edition of his TRPG, is set in Night City, an American dystopian metropolis that features cyber-equipped, street-savvy mercenaries (“edgerunners”) who stylishly break into secure facilities to extract valuable goods. These edgerunners are “survivors in a tough, grim world, faced with life and death choices […The] quintessential Cyberpunk character is a rebel with a cause” (Pondsmith et al. 3). Pondsmith envisioned the TRPG prose and game mechanics required for players to successfully run their own cyberpunk stories and established the boundaries, norms, values, and verbs of most successor cyberpunk game titles.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:23:39","","159-162","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","","","Num Pages: 5","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current work highlights that (1) imagination is a higher order mental function, (2) powerful in its effects, which (3) facilitates intersubjectivity, and (4) is socially constructive. However, sociology can additionally contribute to scholarly understandings of imagination, which have often focused on individualistic mental imaging, by highlighting the degree to which (a) imagination allows individuals and groups to coordinate identities, actions, and futures, (b) imagination relies on widely shared cultural elements, and (c) imagination is often undertaken collectively, in groups.

Being a game played through an extended series of performative utterances, researchers are able to observe the expression, experimentation, and exploration of identities as a negotiated process among players. Of particular interest are the expression of identities that may be marginalized and thus closeted by bearers. For TRPG players with stigmatized identities, the game serves as a back-channel function for enacting these identity performances. This study found that players used the game to experiment with, express, and explore through a confluence of validating communication to facilitate authentic or sincere play. As a result, players more fully immersed themselves in the narrative experience which was used to integrate underdeveloped facets of identity into their primary identity. These findings support the forwarding of theoretical and material contributions that communication scholars can find by studying TRPG spaces, particularly those used by people with marginalized identities.","2020","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-07 14:20:59","2022-04-06 20:46:48","","85","","","","","""A World Where They Belonged""","","","","","San Diego State University","San Diego, CA","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","MA Communication Studies","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798569971398","","","","_identity; _dnd; _gender; _minority; _lgbtq; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","Communication phenomena; Identity performances; Marginalized identities; Queer; Stigmatized identities; Tabletop roleplaying games; Women","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the player base in the D&D community are those that gleaned its potential to offer a conducive space for personal growth, particularly in the realm of psychosocial development, given that D&D sessions facilitated dynamic social interactions among the members. The emphasis on imagination in D&D nurtures the tenets of intermodal expression, as players are encouraged to explore their creativity through the embodiment of their character in addition to engaging in the fictional play-space, which appeals to such concepts in expressive arts therapy as in expanding the range of play by decentering into an alternative reality or alternative world experience. This literature review desired to address the gap in literature analyzing D&D as a creative tool for social skills development, especially for adolescents who are in the process of cultivating their unique personalities. Recommendations for utilizing this method in a therapeutic setting were provided in addition to a fully conceptualized outline for a ten-week group curriculum which may act as a springboard for inspiring future endeavors in incorporating D&D roleplay with the selected population.","2022-05-21","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:12:30","","","44","","","","","Building Character by Building Characters","","","","","Lesley University","","en","","Expressive Art Therapies","","","Zotero","","","","","","_therapy; _empathy; _yo13-19; _oral communication; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _character; _literature review; _soft skills; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on the effectiveness of TTRPG’s in the context of narrative therapy evidences great potential for building resilience and improving the wellbeing of participants (Enfield, 2007; Zayas &amp; Lewis, 1986; Kato &amp; Fujino, 2015). However, throughout the existing literature of games as therapy, less consideration has been spent on the design of the games themselves, primarily using out of the box games such as Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) as the game world without significant adapting of the work to suit the client (Ascherman, 1993; Blackmon, 1994; Kato et al, 2012; Rosselet &amp; Stauffer, 2013). Due to the popularity and commercial availability of D&amp;D, it is no surprise that this is the game of choice for therapists. The potential of a TTRPG is the opportunity of collaborative, agentic storytelling apparently unconstrained by technology and scaffolded by an analogue system of dice and character sheets, but what the game system itself is contributing to the therapeutic experience is not typically examined. This lack of exploration of its specific contributions coupled with the fact that the game itself has been criticized for its overt cultural biases (Garcia, 2017) provides an opportunity for design lead research to ask what more can be done?","2021-02-09","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-05-12 12:35:58","","","","","","","Critical Fail","","","","","Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA)","Australia","en","free_to_read","","","","eprints.qut.edu.au","","Meeting Name: Digital Games Research Australia National Conference&lt;br/>","","","","_therapy; _well-being; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Games Research Australia National Conference&lt;br/>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to external threats and resultant internalized oppression, however, individuals can experience identity distress in addition to a host of other mental health challenges, exacerbated by the difficulty of finding culturally-informed mental healthcare. Gay affirmative therapy and forms of narrative therapy developed in response to this need; additionally, the camaraderie of group settings holds special significance for the LGBTQIA+ community, and existing research highlights the efficacy of group treatment for queer-identified individuals. As initial, promising data suggest tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) can promote self-insight and enhance connection within a therapeutic context, further examination shows that TTRPGs also utilize many of the widely-accepted principles of group therapies like psychodrama, play therapy, and adventure therapy, thus challenging decades of erroneous linkage between such games and the development of psychopathology. Due to their inherent focus on community-building and affirmative identity exploration through the enhanced safety of narrative transference, TTRPGs offer a promising framework for implementing best practice with LGBTQIA-oriented treatment groups. This dissertation introduces an updated structure for TTRPGs called Roll for Wellness that highlights therapeutic elements with a rulebook created specifically for use in group therapy settings, reimagined character creation template, and an initial campaign designed to focus on queer identity development with optional content about depression.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-16 01:03:25","2022-05-12 17:34:47","","153","","","","","Roll for Wellness","","","","","Widener University","Chester","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","PhD Psychology","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798426851542","","","","_therapy; _lgbtq; _anxiety; _well-being; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we look at how we can inform the design of computational tools for GMs through the use of qualitative interviews. We interview GMs about their process in preparing for and running a beginner TTRPG module, Lost Mine of Phandelver, and present to them a prototype of a computational tool built based on this module that has some of the features we believe would be useful in a GMing assistant, such as consolidating information for easier reference, serving as a brainstorming tool for GMs, and helping GMs keep track of what has happened in the game world. From these interviews, we collected insights into how the GMing process works within the context of a specific scenario and found which features GMs liked and what could be improved with our digital prototype. We also compare the results of these interviews to online advice for GMing the module. We use these insights in order to speculate about possible design directions for further development of a GM’s computational assistant.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_virtual table; _GMing; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _ux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to this approach, my intention is to indicate how the use of the Theatre of Mind in the educational environment can be an integral asset; not only in teaching school's subjects (ex. Language, History, Physics etc.) but also in teaching behavior, culture, ideals, and ethical values. Therefore, it aims at student's mental and emotional stimulation targeting the integration of mental and emotional process emphasizing the latter. Thus, the Theatre of Mind may provoke and develop concrete emotions, manners and behavior through simulating real life. It is a method that may provide a unique experience for the student.

The Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) presents a well-researched, broad, conceptual framework for systemic social and emotional learning (CASEL, 2020), which has been used to guide the development and implementation of the proposed pilot. It identifies five competencies of SEL: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationships skills, and responsible decision-making. The CASEL framework also emphasizes the importance of coordinating SEL across key settings and contexts—classroom, schools, families, and communities. Lack of SEL can have suboptimal effects during adolescence and later in life, consequently, impacting occupational engagement. A literature review on SEL found that appropriate SEL programming results in positive outcomes, such as improved school-related attitudes and behaviors, increased academic performance, decreased negative behaviors, and less reports of emotional distress (Durlak et al., 2010, 2011). Additionally, various school-related professions address SEL, however, there is limited evidence of occupational therapy practitioners’ involvement in the literature. Thus, adolescents’ occupational needs relating to SEL may not be being addressed. Play’s significance in developing adolescents’ skills is rooted in SEL. Play “develop[s] physical coordination, emotional maturity, social skills to interact with other children, and self-confidence to try new experiences and explore new environments” (AOTA, 2012, p.1). Dungeons & Dragons® (D&D) is a popular table-top role-playing game, which draws interest from many adolescents and adults. A second literature review found that play interventions for adolescents, and research using D&D appears to be limited. Role for SEL is a play-based intervention group using D&D (5th ed.) developed to promote SEL. In the pilot program, three to five middle-school students will participate in 90-minute after-school sessions, for 10 weeks. Participants will learn how to play D&D, receive explicit instruction on two SEL competencies (self-management and relationship skills) and engage in D&D scenarios and campaigns designed to support development in the relevant SEL areas. The author’s proposed pilot program has the potential to improve adolescents’ SEL and occupational engagement. This doctoral project discusses the case for the proposed pilot program, and presents a detailed overview of Role for SEL.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-03-04 14:22:55","2022-05-20 22:13:01","","132","","","","","Role for SEL","","","","","Boston University","Boston","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Occupational Therapy","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798438739487","","","","_therapy; _dnd; _yo13-19; _anxiety; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _soft skills; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","Dungeons and Dragons; Adolescent; D&D; CASEL; Occupational therapy; Social-emotional learning; ttrpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In diesem Gespräch spricht er über Einflüsse in seiner akademischen Laufbahn und prägende intellektuelle Entscheidungen. Er gilt als ""serieller Ethnograf"", der in zahlreichen Feldkontexten gearbeitet hat und dabei einerseits Kleingruppen und eine von Menschen bevölkerte Ethnografie favorisiert, sich andererseits mit Gerüchten, Klatsch und moralischen Geschichten beschäftigt, die in kleinen und größeren Publiken erzählt werden. FINE beschreibt sein theoretisches Kerninteresse als die Untersuchung des Wechselspiels von Struktur, Interaktion und Kultur. In seinem Werk analysiert er die vielfältigen ortsgebundenen Arten und Weisen, in denen Gesellschaft von Menschen in formellen und informellen sozialen Settings verwirklicht wird, angefangen bei Baseballteams über Restaurantküchen oder die Wetterberichterstattung bis hin zum Schachspielen –um nur einige wenige Gegenstände seiner Forschungen zu nennen. Wesentlich beeinflusst durch symbolisch-interaktionistisches Denken und im Rekurs auf weitere wichtige Perspektiven auf soziale Welten plädiert er für eine selbstbewusste Haltung der ethnografischen Forschung und des ethnografischen Schreibens sowie für die Bedeutung der Konzeptarbeit in einer theorie-informierten empirischen Soziologie dessen, was Menschen zusammen tun.

Considered to be a ""serial ethnographer"" who has worked in multiple settings, his work focuses on small groups and peopled ethnography, as well as on rumors, gossip, and moral story telling in tiny and larger publics. FINE describes his core theoretical interest as residing in the interplay of structure, interaction, and culture and discusses the multiple local ways society is realized by people in formal and informal social settings: ranging from baseball teams, restaurant kitchens, weather reporting to chess players—to name but a few research sites. Influenced by symbolic interactionist thinking and other important approaches to social worlds, he argues for a confident voice of ethnographic research and writing as well as the importance of conceptual work in a theory-informed empirical sociology of what people do together.","2021","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:04:11","2022-05-20 22:14:07","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2021.

This paper explains our didactic approach for engaging students into active learning for developing soft skills and to make them aware of the importance of this topic in relation to their professional future. The track ’Storytelling’ in our Game Development and Simulation program is perfectly suited for applying a didactic approach in which soft skills are naturally integrated in lectures and examination. We so do by utilising the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. The game involves grouping students together to solve several story-driven challenges. The students have to collaborate and apply their creativity to solve these presented problems and overcome obstacles.

Additionally, this research sought to determine whether these discovered gratifications overlapped at all with perceived similar media, specifically massive multiplayer online roleplaying games, MMORPGs, and social media. A series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews designed to elicit relevant responses were conducted with 14 respondents, followed by a thematic analysis to determine gratifications. The qualitative analysis determined a set of 24 gratifications, each categorized under social, immersion, narrative, and achievement labels. Among these included potentially unique gratifications such as story creation, control, creativity, freedom, and identity exploration. Moreover, while many similar gratifications were determined for D&D and MMORPGs, very few overlapping gratifications emerged between D&D and social media, possibly due to the latter's lack of available immersion gratifications. This research provides an insight as to why audience members choose to actively engage with a form of entertainment media previously discounted in scholarly literature, and how these reasons to engage differ from more modern, similar available media types.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-05 14:29:00","","","82","","","","","","","","","","University of Central Florida","Orlando","en","","MA Communication","","","Zotero","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"TJZ8X82U","thesis","2022","Hines, Mark","Fantasies of Race and Place: White Nationalist and Alt-Right Undercurrents in Fantasy Roleplaying Games","","","","","https://uknowledge.uky.edu/english_etds/143","Representations of fantasy settings in roleplaying games often draw upon understandings of the medieval and early Renaissance world. This dynamic often extends to racial politics in such worlds. For the contemporary roleplaying game, this often means that game mechanics are built around race, species, or gender. Often, players interpret such mechanics as a means of bioessentializing race or practicing stereotypes rooted in Eurocentric morality and values. This thesis examines the underlying rhetoric and implicit stakes by which race in fantasy worlds overlaps with the rhetoric and proposed stakes of White Nationalist and Alt-right actors. As fantasy roleplaying games, and especially analog games, have evaded scholarly attention, little has been said about the burgeoning, identitarian movements in such communities and the ways in which these communities interpret popular gaming artifacts. This work reveals ongoing issues in representing race, medievalisms, and the genre of fantasy.","2022-01-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","75","","","","","Fantasies of Race and Place","","","","","University of Kentucky","Lexington","en","","MA English","","","","","https://doi.org/10.13023/etd.2022.172","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, in many universities, technology-oriented master’s degree programs include EIA teaching courses. At the University of Firenze (Italy), one such EIA course module was complemented by a role-playing game in which students acted as typical characters involved in a (simulated) public debate concerning the possible development of a geothermal plant in a rural environment. The roles were designed with competing objectives and contrasting codes of conduct; therefore, the evolution of the debate and the final outcome (acceptance/rejection of the project) were completely in the hands of the players. The game was played with different classes, and the experience was successful. The students reported that the following objectives were reached: (i) they had fun; (ii) they put into practice some theoretical concepts learned during the lessons; (iii) they understood that aspects other than technical ones can be involved in decision processes and dealing with them without proper preparation is very difficult. This last point was considered particularly important, and demonstrated that this role-playing game represented a valuable complement to the main teaching activities.","2022-05","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-30 01:38:58","2022-06-14 20:26:51","051003","","5","4","","Environ.

Scholars have written about innovation in diverse fields despite weak or nonexistent IP rights, such as fashion design, fine cuisine, stand-up comedy, magic tricks, tattoos, and sports plays. Instead, these fields rely on social norms, first- mover advantage, and other (non-IP) legal regimes to promote innovation in the absence of IP protection. As a comparison to these studies, this Article comprehensively analyzes the role of IP law in facilitating innovation in tabletop gaming, including board games, card games, and pen-and-paper role-playing games. Over the past several decades, the tabletop gaming industry has seen a proliferation of innovation, but there is surprisingly little in the academic literature about IP and tabletop games. IP rights, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, each protect certain aspects of games, while at the same time being constrained by doctrinal limitations that leave considerable flexibility for others to develop their own games and adapt or improve upon existing ones. There are also numerous examples of user-based innovation in tabletop gaming. This Article concludes by contending that IP rights, as well as their limitations, play a significant role in facilitating the robust innovation presently occurring in the tabletop gaming field.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-30 01:39:44","","1615-1683","","","107","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_boardgame; _dnd; _copyright; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _law studies; _empirical work; _OTHER GAMES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using Dungeons and Dragons as the ubiquitous example of a TTRPG that operates on foundations of hierarchy, coloniality, and violence, I consider the reframing of discourses that their designers achieve through how they structure character and world creation and player interaction. These games exemplify counter-hegemonic, decolonial practices of game design and play by undoing the player-gamemaster hierarchy, changing the apparatuses that mediate in-game and out-of-game discourses, and increasing the value of lived experience and subject positionalities for players and characters. Collaborative processes and structures that increase player agency and relationship-building shift the objectives of gameplay from conquest and domination to building a mutually satisfying narrative and emphasizing the value of empowering and uplifting other players. I’ll also be attentive to the structure of Dream Askew and Wanderhome in my primary analysis, taking inspiration from their configurations as a conversation and a journey, respectively. Through considering these games as attending to a broader range of experiences and reimagining game design for a more inclusive audience, I position them as examples that can inspire game designers to consider the discourse their games enact and TTRPG players to recognize what a game’s structures restrict or enable in their play experience.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2022-06-14 20:49:12","","72","","","","","Changing the Game","","","","","University of North Carolina at Greensboro","Greensboro","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","MA","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798438781196","","","","_dice; _publishing; _minority; _conversation; _TTRPG; _belonging; _GMless; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the past couple of years, they have also taken the digital world by storm.    This thesis explores the early stages of the design process of a tabletop role-playing game. The topic was chosen for two reasons. First, despite the continuously growing popularity of tabletop role-playing games, the design practicalities and methods of tabletop role-playing designers haven't been a subject of many major academic studies. Second, my own interest towards game design and tabletop role-playing games drove me to research the subject.    The thesis starts with a literature review that presents existing literature and definitions around the topic of game design in general and tabletop role-playing game design in particular. LARP (live action role-playing) design theory is also covered briefly. The theoretical framework concentrates on ideas, design goals and prototypes, the three main interest areas of my research. The research topic was then approached by interviewing seven role-playing game designers from Finland, Australia, Sweden and the United States. The data was analyzed in the manner of qualitative content analysis, and transformed into themes and patterns that are presented as findings. In the end, several interesting themes and design practices were recognized. All the research is conducted by following the principles and ideas of explorative research.    According to the research findings, the design process of tabletop role-playing games focuses heavily around writing. Majority of the designers describe their design work to be writing, and it seems that the act of writing and rewriting is the main tool of thinking for the designers. Another major finding was that the ideas and inspirations seem to be growing from a mixture of genre fiction, personal experiences and nostalgia, and that in the very heart of a viable RPG idea is always a certain experience or emotion. Also, the viable ideas, those that actually lead to published games are always described to be solid and “whole” from the beginning of the design process.    The findings offer a good starting point for any further research. Also, any aspiring tabletop role-playing game designer will find the findings valuable and helpful when designing their own tabletop role-playing games.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-09-28 15:07:55","2022-06-15 15:35:49","","70","","","","","“I have a theme in my head, and then I start to write”","","","","","Aalto University","Espoo, Finland","en","","Master's Programme in Collaborative and Industrial Design","","","aaltodoc2.org.aalto.fi","","Accepted: 2022-06-09T13:39:57Z","","","","_publishing; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study focuses on the reasons for code-switching, how code-switching is used as a resource in tabletop role-playing games as well as the participants’ perceived attitudes towards it. The position of English as a lingua franca has changed during past decades and the language has grown to be much more than a traditional lingua franca. In addition to being spoken between non-native speakers of English who do not share a language, it is also used in interactions between non-native speakers who share a native tongue. One of the contexts where this happens is tabletop role-playing games. The tabletop role-playing community has seen a large growth in members during recent years and the popularity of the hobby is continuously on the rise. The gaming community is widely international, and a lot of content is only available in English. This research discusses the code-switching habits of a six-person role-playing group where all the participants’ native language is Finnish. The groups language of play is English.  This study is an ethnographic qualitative study that uses four different data collection methods: audio recordings, observation and fieldnotes, interviews and a questionnaire. The materials for the study are 10.5 hours of audio recordings (6.5h + 3.5h), fieldnotes, a four-question structured interview, and an online language background questionnaire. The audio data was analysed using applied conversation analysis and Goffman’s participant framework while the interviews were analysed using applied thematic analysis. During the analysis of the audio the data was divided into four sub-sections: word searches, cultural references, asymmetry of knowledge, and out of game talk.  The findings show that code-switching was used in a multitude of situations and for a variety of reasons. The most prominent ones being word search and shifting the participant framework. In cases of word search, code-switching was utilised to sustain the flow of the narrative as well as to maintain immersion in the world of the game. In cases where code-switching was used to shift the participant framework, it broke the immersion and signalled that the conversation was no longer happening inside the game world. Code-switching and shifting the participant framework made the conversation move to the foreground and take over the existing mainline. In this context, code-switching was also used as a tool of authority. In addition, in the data code-switching was used as a tool of emphasis and creativity. Different cases of code-switching pointed towards English being the language of the world of fantasy while Finnish was the language of the outside world. It was also found that code-switching was always accompanied by a change in style, tempo or volume. To get more in-depth knowledge about the indexes of code-switching in the contexts of tabletop role-playing games, further study is needed.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:10:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Helsinki","Helsinki","","","Master's thesis in English Studies","","","","","","","","","_language learning; _oral communication; _conversation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2KUZN76X","thesis","2022","Ott, Noelle B.","Tabletop Roleplaying Games, and Depression, and Social Anxiety","","","","","https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/honors/767","Tabletop roleplaying games are a form of in-person, multiplayer games structured around group interaction, set rules of gameplay, strategic group decision-making, and active character roleplaying. While such games have existed in some form for thousands of years, more recent and modern versions such as Dungeons & Dragons and Call of Cthulhu have increased attention not only to their use as a form of entertainment, but as a potential extension of play and drama therapies in a clinical setting (Henrich & Worthington, 2021). Research into therapeutic roleplaying, both with and without gameplay supervision, has shown a promising association with increased understanding of self-concept and connection to community (House, 1970; Winn, 1959) as well as a reduction in depression and anxiety (Burroughs, Wagner & Johnson, 1997; Wilde, 1994). However, historical investigations have primarily concentrated on younger age groups, where play and drama therapies are most frequently employed with a focus on individual development and social connections. Recent studies have only just begun to investigate tabletop roleplaying games as a form of therapy; most have involved case-studies that apply theoretical and anecdotal, rather than clinical, evidence of the game’s effective use as a mechanism of therapeutic treatment (Blackmon, 1994; Hughes, 1988). The current study aimed to extend tabletop roleplaying games research to a larger, more varied age group (N = 184, Average age = 19.2) through an online survey. We assessed participants’ experience with the game and reasons to participate in gameplay, and examined any correlations between levels of depression, anxiety, and amount of participation in tabletop roleplaying games. Results indicated that participants generally felt that tabletop roleplaying games supported their mental health and well-being, particularly in the context of roleplaying in their character’s mindset. We also found that frequency of play was negatively associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, even when controlling for predictors on the Ten Item Personality Measure such as conscientiousness and emotional stability (Gosling et al., 2003). This may suggest that individuals experiencing depression or social anxiety turn to tabletop roleplaying games as a method to respond and cope with these symptoms. The implications of these results, as well as directions for further research in this burgeoning field are discussed.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-06-27 15:42:33","","94","","","","","","","","","","University of Maine","","en","","BA Psychology","","","digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu","","","","","","_mental disorder; _therapy; _anxiety; _well-being; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By integrating contemporary game studies with filmic adaptation studies and literary theory, I argue that game adaptations allow us to see how games, adaptations, and indeed all texts can be productively conceived of as Barthesian networks of meaning: collections of interacting formal, narrative, intertextual, and contextual elements from which a user’s experience arises. Doing so destabilizes the primacy of concepts that are so often used to justify hierarchical relationships between “high art” and popular culture, opening up new interpretations of texts which do not lend themselves to analysis via traditional literary or cinematic methodologies. Thinking of adaptations in terms of the systemized relationships between texts, intertexts, and the user rather than as merely derivative copies of a single “original” also redefines the classically hierarchical relationship between adaptations and their sources that has plagued adaptation studies discourse from its inception. Through my readings of a variety of digital and analog games based on William Shakespeare’s Hamlet (Ryan North’s gamebook To Be or Not to Be), J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit (Beam Software’s Hobbit text-adventure), Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice (Storybrewers’ tabletop roleplaying game Good Society), and Henry David Thoreau’s Walden (Tracy Fullerton’s contemplative digital “walking simulator” Walden, a game), I illustrate how thinking of texts as systems affords interpretatively productive play, encouraging users to reinterpret, revise, and remix culture to their own ends.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-28 18:00:12","2022-06-27 15:57:27","","277","","","","","‘Play the Book Again’","","","","","Syracuse University","Syracuse","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. English","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798819366967","","","","_story vs game; _storygame; _adaptation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _CYOA","Board games; Film; Digital games; Game studies; Literary adaptation; New media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using monster theory, queer ecofeminist theory, and intertextuality theory, the methods in which TTRPGs use ecophobia to motivate players and form literary narratives are examined.

This paper first reviews the history of TTRPGs beginning with HG Wells’ Little Wars, discusses the creation of the other within TTRPG game worlds, analyzes the premade worlds which are sold, and concludes with a linguistic analysis of TTRPGs as it is connected to the ecocritical literary theory.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-06-29 13:41:54","","67","","","","","Tabletop Roleplaying Games and Emergent Ecophobia","","","","","Iowa State University","Ames","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A. English Literature","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798819396698","","","","_ecology; _dnd; _minority; _lgbtq; _TTRPG; _pbta; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","Ecocriticism; Ecophobia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, we examine the capabilities of several models on the task of generating new content for this game, evaluating the performance through the use of both score-based methods and a survey on the best performing model to determine how the generated content conforms to the rules of the game and how well they might be used in the game.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 15:16:21","","54-60","","","","","","","","","","","","Marseille, 25 June 2022","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_worldbuilding; _procedural storytelling; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _ai ml llm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The original face-to-face way of playing has been complemented by online play using dedicated digital tools, and play itself has become spectator entertainment. In this article, I explore the process of mediatization of tabletop role-playing on the example of Critical Role – the most successful ‘actual play’ show, in which performers broadcast tabletop role-playing to audiences. I highlight the importance of commodification as a force in the process of mediatization, involving licensing, merchandising, and advertising. Empirically, the article is grounded in an analysis of Critical Role’s sponsorships and embodied player practices, focusing on the political-economic aspects of the show. While Critical Role presents a profoundly mediated form of tabletop role-playing, it promotes a traditional face-to-face way of playing using physical accessories both by cast members’ preference of such accessories (except for the digital toolset D&D Beyond) and sponsorships from manufacturers of these products. Mediatization of tabletop role-playing thus happens through an economic-driven process of addition – new mediated options for players with new opportunities for commodification exist alongside analog modes of consumption. As shown on the example of Critical Role, the digital and mediated forms of the analog hobby can be harnessed to promote physical consumerism.","2022-06-29","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-11-16 16:59:23","2022-07-04 13:18:59","1-17","","0","0","","Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies","Mediatization of tabletop role-playing","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd QID: Q113017190","","","","_dnd; _actual play; _economics; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; =PM; _empirical work; _MEDIA","Dungeons & Dragons; analog games; commodification; mediatization; Twitch; virtual tabletop","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Now enjoying its 7th consecutive year of record profits, D&D has grown alongside a wave of D&D media, with the traditional board game taking on new digital forms that alter how players can now interact with the hobby. Utilizing media theories such as figurations, Medium Theory, the Magic Circle, and the concept of media worlds, this paper l:ooks at both the media objects being consumed and what influences they left with their user. Interpretive focus groups were used to collect testimony from groups that played D&D together, examining individual impacts and how groups as a whole negotiated their media use while playing. When looking at media consumed, it appears that the most common Uses by participants included Entertainment, gathering Information, or finding Tools to use during gameplay. Overall, Tool media were the most frequently utilized, although the physical distancing required by COVID-19 was cited as a factor in this widespread use. Demonstrated by the Engagement-Consumption-Impacts model, the major influences discovered were increases in the user's Game Knowledge and a decrease in the level of Rules-Adhesion, or how strictly the written rules of the game were enforced. Other findings included participants changing the style in which they played D&D, basing changes off the habits of players they watched online or strategies found to become ""better"" players. This study also suggests further implications of the theories used. In particular, the study of the ""alpha media object,"" media capable of impacting the user, the other media objects surrounding it, and even the figuration model as a whole, leaves several questions for future scholars to examine. In this study, that alpha media object was the podcast Critical Role (2015), a show so popular that it has begun to impact not just players, but the game of Dungeons & Dragons itself; the larger implications of the alpha media object, however, can be extended to the study of any media ecosystem or user.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-07-06 14:16:18","","262","","","","","Dungeons & Dragons & Figurations","","","","","Bowling Green State University","Bowling Green","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Communication Studies","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798802752630","","","","_dnd; _actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","Dungeons & Dragons; Game studies; D Media impacts; Figurations; Media studies; Medium theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines how race is constructed in fantasy texts utilizing an essentialist framework wherein race is determinative of individual morality, psyche, and aptitude. In imagining race in fantastical worlds, high fantasy texts reproduce the ideas of unabashedly white supremacist race philosophers such as Carl Linnaeus, Arthur de Gobineau, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, applying them to fantastical beings rather than real world groups. The same racial logics that informed Nazism are seen at play in The Lord of the Rings, Dungeons and Dragons, and World of Warcraft. This thesis will examine how the essentialist framework is utilized through the three most common racial groups in high fantasy: Dwarves, Orcs, and Elves. In examining each of these groups in turn, broad patterns of how race is imagined become clear. Stereotypes about real-world groups are imported into fantastical worlds, where they are often combined and remixed over time by successive waves of authors. In comparing different fantasy texts, we see how the characterization of particular races changes with time to reflect the culture of the eras that produce them. In some cases, these re-imaginings are done directly in opposition to previous texts in attempts to correct offensive caricatures. However, even as imagined races themselves have changed with time, the overall concept of ?race? in high fantasy remains mired in an essentialist mindset.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-07-06 14:22:33","","141","","","","","","","","","","College of Bowling Green State University","","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798834020318","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _tolkien; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY","Fantasy; Role playing games; Racism; Ethnic studies; Popular culture; Tolkien","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve the objective of showing in the teacher’s narrative, who considers his practice with games as creative insubordinate, manifestations of responsible subversion actions, including creative self-insubordination, we use the theoretical contributions of teaching probability, teaching from games and of creative insubordination. In the literature on the subject, categories of teaching actions considered creative insubordinate were searched. Confronting the teacher’s narrative with these categories, as a result, indications of responsible subversion were found that widen such categories, such as professional visibility, in addition to a reflection on dress codes in the teacher’s workplace.

Implementing such an active learning program, however, is sometimes daunting to overburdened professors and teaching assistants. This book addresses the challenges of using games and simulations in the political science classroom, both online and in person. Each chapter offers a game or simulation that politics teachers can use to teach course concepts and explains ways to execute it effectively. In addition, the authors in this volume make a proactive case for games and simulations. Each chapter offers research to evaluate the effectiveness of the activity and pedagogical design best practices. Thus, the book not only serves as a game design resource, but also offers demonstrable support for using games and simulations in the political science classroom. Aimed at teachers at all levels, from high school through college, the book may be especially appealing to graduate students entering teaching for the first time and open to new teaching and learning approaches.","2022-08-30","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","318","","","","","Simulations in the Political Science Classroom","","","","","Routledge","New York","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.4324/9781003144106","","","","_simulation; _rttp; _leadership; _negotiation; _politics; _economics; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned; _law studies; _LEARNING","","Harvey, Mark; Fielder, James; Gibb, Ryan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The hypotheses tested whether playing a character that differed from a student with regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status affected whether students would be more knowledgeable and sympathetic to those groups after the treatment. Results showed slight increases in knowledge and sympathy for both privileged and less privileged demographic groups, although most results were not statistically significant. In particular, after the game, students perceived more discrimination against Asian-Americans. They also felt more knowledgeable about African-Americans, Asian-Americans, high socioeconomic status (SES) individuals and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans (LGBT) community. Finally, they felt more sympathy toward women, Asian-Americans, Caucasians, high SES individuals and the LGBT community.

We show how GMs prepare and deploy readymade artifacts: analog and digital CSTs that flexibly mediate recurring creative tasks in their practice, such as improvising narrative elements, facilitating smooth play, and creating aesthetic effects. We find that GMs demonstrate designerly thinking as they create, share, and refine repertoires of readymade artifacts.

It theorizes the agentic capacities of human players and media entities (the games themselves; the various other media that constitute the media environment) as existing in a productive tension that shapes the media environment. Findings highlight the specific media environment of in-person tabletop gameplay; the specific media environment of digital tabletop gameplay; the ways in which players work with and against commercial entities (e.g. game publishers) to access digital adaptations; the power of the game-as-media to shape the media environment; the importance of players’ socialized identities and the ways in which these shape the media environment; and the negotiation that players must undertake to navigate game and interface rules.

Since then, Tabletop RPGs (TRPGs) have been applied in various settings, such as fantasy, horror, sci-fi, western, spy, historical, military, mixtures of two or more. TRPGs are still very popular, transferring small groups of people within a fantasy world that evolves through players’ verbal descriptions. Their interactive roleplay character brings together the ideas and interests of the participants, providing an immersive social and creative experience that entertains players (White, 2018).TRPGs have been applied in various contexts, such as education, business, military, improvisational theatre, health care, leisure. E.g., CodePlay is a TRPG that improves computer programming and teamwork skills via roleplaying (Ntokos, 2020) while City of Dred is another TRPG about data survivability (Lopes, 2015). From another viewpoint, learners could be engaged within a meaningful experience of making, modifying, and sharing their own games. In this constructionist approach, the game becomes an object-to-think-with (Papert, 1991), and learners coherently form and transform their ideas expressed in particular contexts (Ackermann, 2001). Currently, there is a shift in the direction of game-making for learning, however, there are no results that focus on TRPGs and their influence on learning and motivation.ObjectiveWe argue that the design of TRPGs has the potential to provide a rich learning experience that motivates game makers, while, at the same time, they have the chance to create a fully functional game, practicing all the required steps of the game making process. A medieval stage could be used to place the characters and the game action, motivating game makers in the design process. Imagination, brainstorming, and looking at the literature are combined with decisions regarding the game mechanics and lots of playtesting. Therefore, it is important to identify the effects of this process on learners, especially in motivation and learning aspects. As a result, our research question that we will investigate is formulated below:RQ: Which are the effects of the TRPGs design process on the participants’ motivation and learning?MethodWe performed a pilot study with 16 university students. We introduced participants to the RPGs game genre, having a particular focus on their tabletop form. We familiarized them with the TRPGs gameplay and the required steps of the design process. Then, we asked them to design TRPGs in the context of Corfu’s medieval history. We describe some representative summaries of the produced projects and discuss preliminary findings derived from informal observations and conversations with the students. The findings will be used as a basis for the game-making approach.ConclusionThis study provides evidence on the use of TRPGs as the context which engages participants in a game-making learning process. The creation of the fictional world deeply immersed most participants in the process. They were engaged in the repetitive form of making games which involved designing, evaluating, and improving their designs towards functional tabletop games. Clearly, this field of study displays a number of characteristics that can be highly beneficial for the identification of the motivation and learning mechanisms of this highly immersive game-making process.References1.

"ABPGPE2G","thesis","2017","Reed, Aaron A.","Changeful Tales: Design-Driven Approaches Toward More Expressive Storygames","","","","","https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8838j82v","Stories in released games are still based largely on static and predetermined structures, despite decades of academic work to make them more dynamic. Making game narratives more playable is an important step in the evolution of games and playable media as culturally relevant art forms. In the same way interactive systems help students learn about complicated subjects like physics in a more intuitive and immediate way than static texts, more dynamic interactive stories open up new ways of understanding people and situations. Such dreams remain mostly unrealized in released and playable games.In this dissertation I will describe a number of design and technical solutions to the problem of creating more expressive and dynamic storygames, informed by a practice-based approach to game production. I will first define a framework for the analysis of games, including especially the terms storygame (a playable system with units of narrative where the understanding of the interconnectedness between story and system is crucial) and the notion of narrative logics (the set of processes that define how player input affects the next unit of story presented by the system). I will exercise this framework on an existing and well-known storygame genre, the adventure game, and use it to make a number of claims about the mechanics and dynamics of narratives in this genre that are borne out by an analysis of how contemporary games adopting some of its aesthetics succeed and fail. I will then describe three emerging storygame modes that are still in the process of being defined, developing a critical framework for each informed by close readings and historical analysis, and considering what design and technical innovations are required to fully realize the new mode's potential. These three modes I discuss are sculptural fiction (which shifts the focus from navigating to building a structure of narrative nodes), social simulation (games that explore the possibility space created by a set of simulated characters and rules for social interaction), and collaborative storygames (in which the lexia are generated at least in part by the participants during play). Each theoretical chapter is paired with a case study of one or several fully completed and released games I have created or co-created in that mode, to see how these design ideas were realized and technical advancements implemented in practice. I will conclude each section with applied advice for game makers hoping to work in these new spaces, and new technological developments that will help storygames continue to evolve and prosper.","2017","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-07-27 19:56:27","","446","","","","","Changeful Tales","","","","","UC Santa Cruz","Santa Cruz","en","","PhD Computer Science","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","_storygame; _narrative authority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two moral panics involving children’s entertainment media—the “Satanic Panic” of the 1980s and the news media’s reaction to the Columbine High School shooting in 1999—solidified the public image of the gamer as a White male who was vulnerable to suggestions of violence or self-harm in games. Historically, White men and boys were the assumed audience for TRPGs. This dissertation puts the lived experiences of women and nonbinary gamers from several generations into historical context. It argues that changes to gaming culture have been changes to visibility and accessibility of and for marginalized gamers.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2022-08-02 16:07:38","","209","","","","","Gender Rolls","","","","","University of Minnesota","","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798837556456","","","","_dnd; _gender; _nostalgia; _TTRPG; _roleplay; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY","Audience studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on work in the domains of narrative processing, embodiment, affective production and perception, intertextuality, and the boundaries of play, this research investigates the role of language use in facilitating playful interaction and affect. TTRPG sessions are entertaining, playful experiences aimed at collaborative narrative building through the use of synthetic characters in a fictional world. Players speak as their characters, acting out their desires, motivations, and actions. The goal of TTRPG play is the collaborative construction of a narrative, and work in Discourse Studies has established that emotional narratives are more compelling and impactful than their non-emotional counterparts, generating identification and involvement from audience members with story world characters. TTRPG players, however, are in the unique position of both audience and creator, since their response to story world stimuli has the capacity to influence events in the narrative being constructed. Work in games scholarship illustrates that in emotional story world circumstances of conflict, loss, resolution, and levity, players employ affective cues to represent their characters’ emotions, even if it ’bleeds’ into a strong emotional response that has potential negative repercussions for the player. This research attempts to address the question of why players perform this affect, examining ten excerpts of play from Critical Role, an actual play Dungeons & Dragons show, that immediately follow or concern emotional story world circumstances and analyzing them for affective cues, their appraisal and affirmation, navigation across the game-reality boundary, and players’ capacity for creative language use. Ultimately, this work aims to contribute to the broader question of why we play narrative games and what we get out of them, through its analysis of the role played by language in facilitating creative interaction.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:11:33","2022-08-02 19:59:27","","","","","","","","","","","","Utrecht University","Utrecht","en","CC-BY-NC-ND","Master Thesis in  Linguistics","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","Accepted: 2022-07-28T01:02:00Z","","","","_language learning; _bleed; _group dynamics; _oral communication; _linguistics; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _EMOTIONS; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study intends to provide insights on controlling COVID-19 spread in Malang, Indonesia. This research is a quantitative study with correlative analytic observational design and a cross-sectional approach involving 120 nurses from 16 primary health centers. The results of the bivariate analysis using gamma correlation test are: knowledge factors (p=0.005; r=0.35), attitude (p=0.000; r=0.46), means of infrastructure (p=0.000; r=0.54), and self-control (p=0.000; r=0.52) for the quarantined COVID-19 patients. Knowledge, attitude, infrastructure, and safe house factors can influence self-control for COVID-19. In rural areas, health education—as education and empowerment for patient self-control—is an effort to encourage them to obey health protocol during the pandemic. Nurse readiness and preparedness during the pandemic is crucial for strengthening the assertive behavior commitment through self-control. This ensures the community's awareness of the importance of complying with health protocols for the common good. Mental nursing intervention needs to be added as a part of psychosocial therapy for the community's social problems, primarily in reducing the pressure due to the social distancing enforcement to control and prevent COVID-19 spread.","2022-08-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-05 14:28:26","2022-08-08 17:53:29","S54-S57","","","32","","Enfermería Clínica","","3rd Aceh International Nursing Conference (AINC) “Strengthening Resilience from Pandemic Crisis Through Multidisciplinary Approaches","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","QID: Q113482402","","","","_therapy; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _covid19; _medecine-nursing; =cleaned; _empirical work; _LEARNING","Disaster; Preparedness; Readiness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I propose that  online streaming services and online interaction about games have created an under-theorized  subculture of those who engage in the gaming subculture without playing games themselves.    Existing theorisations of subculture in relation to online gaming tend to limit their accounts to  those who are actively engaged in online gaming. However, based on a grounded analysis of  ethnographic observation, surveys, and interviews with the fans for web series Critical Role,  where famous voice actors play Dungeons & Dragons, I found that reasons for and forms of  engagement, include what I have called participatory non-participation. This form of  engagement, while not incorporated into current theorisations of digital subculture, clearly  shares key elements of subculture activity that include a sense of belonging, requirements for  group membership, shared history and symbols. As existing theories are based solely on active  game playing that excludes the crucial element of digital participatory non-participation, it is  appropriate to extend current theorisations to resolve this lacunae and is offered here as a  distinctly new theory of digital subculture: the subculture of the lurker.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-23 12:53:30","2022-08-12 21:41:38","","134","","","","","The subculture of the Lurker","","","","","University of Canterbury","Christchurch","en","All Rights Reserved","MA Sociology","","","ir.canterbury.ac.nz","","DOI:10.26021/13213","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _actual play; _TTRPG; _belonging; =cleaned; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is an inquiry about neuroatypicality and disability. It is also about role-playing game storyworlds, specifically the well-known fantasy game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). Role-playing is the medium through which themes of neurotypicality / atypicality, neuroqueering, and learning as collaborative becoming-in-relation are presented and examined. In the pages of this dissertation, I bring together a rush of stories—stories we know, stories we need to know, and stories that are not yet known and still emerging. Through these, the reader is invited to explore the tracings of family, research, gaming, walking, learning, and education storyworlds. With/in layers of stories, I invite exploration and diffraction through a rush of methods: iterative walking- and playing, and emergent cartographic practices, all based in an affirmative, post-qualitative research ethic of relationality, refusal and the oblique, non-representational gaze. Posthumanism, new materiality, relational ontologies, as well as game and monster studies, support a re/imagining of several important concepts that describe, diagnose, pathologize, and intervene in neuroatypical becoming: social-emotional reciprocity, functional speech, gaze direction and eye contact, and repetitive behaviours. As a postsecondary educator, caregiver, and role-player, my goal for this dissertation is to provoke a collaborative re/examination of our relationship with neuroatypicality, and how it shapes educational spaces and practices. I hope the reader will interrogate the ways in which we embody and enact ""typicality"" as a neutral that pathologizes some ways of being as ""atypical,"" and how that informs and shapes our classrooms and other storyworlds. The reader is encouraged to actively engage with the rush of stories, and to collaboratively question—and re/imagine—teaching and learning practices as storyworlds of becoming-together.","2022-06-20","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:51:34","2022-08-29 13:33:04","","","","","","","Endlessly Becoming Orc","","","","","SIMON FRASER UNIVERSITY","","en","Copyright is held by the author(s).","MA Education","","","","","Publisher: Simon Fraser University","","","","_teaching; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to facilitate development using techniques derived from Tabletop Role Playing Games (TTRPGs). This study explored the effects of role-playing activities, combined with guided character development on goal attainment. The study examined several factors of goal attainment, including motivation and self-efficacy. The study occurred over six bi-weekly one-hour-long sessions. The researcher met with the participants individually, using semi-structured open-ended question interviews and guided character-development techniques. Between each session, the participants role-played their characters. They kept a daily journal of goal-oriented activities, thoughts, and goals, which were reviewed during the bi-weekly interview and used for developing or leveling up each participant’s character. The researcher hypothesized that improvement in the character’s performance would positively impact the goal attainment and self-efficacy of the role-playing individual. The sample included five participants ranging in age from 27 to 28 years old and were recruited via flyers posted at local game stores, online gaming groups and distributed by the researcher. The results showed that utilizing areas of interest such as gaming can increase self-efficacy and goal attainment while engaging in goal-oriented activities.","2022","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2022-08-29 13:45:00","","93","","","","","Can I Level Up to Real Life?","","","","","Chicago School of Professional Psychology","Chicago","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Psy.D.

After nearly five decades, the iconic roleplaying game is more popular than ever. Famous Hollywood actors and directors, therapists, educators, politicians, kids, parents, and grandparents all count themselves as fans. In Welcome to Dragon Talk, hosts of the official D&D podcast Shelly Mazzanoble and Greg Tito and their surprising guests show how this beloved pastime has amassed a diverse, tight-knit following of players who defy stereotypes.   Shelly and Greg recount some of their most inspiring interviews and illuminate how their guests use the core tenets of the game in everyday life. An A-list actor defends D&D by baring his soul (and his muscles) on social media. A teacher in a disadvantaged district in Houston creates a D&D club that motivates students to want to read and think analytically. A writer and live-streamer demonstrates how D&D–inspired communication breaks barriers and empowers people of color. Readers will see why Dungeons & Dragons has remained such a pop culture phenomenon and how it has given this disparate and growing community the inspiration to flourish and spread some in-game magic into the real world.","2022-12-05","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","199","","","","","Welcome to Dragon Talk","","","","","University of Iowa Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: woOFEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=woOFEAAAQBAJ","_fandom; _dnd; _TTRPG; _podcast; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","Games & Activities / Role Playing & Fantasy; Social Science / General; Social Science / Popular Culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We qualitatively code these interviews in order to synthesize a list of techniques GMs can use to move the story forward. We also compare these interviews to other sources of advice for GMing in sourcebooks and essays. Using the GMing techniques found through this analysis, we discuss insights into the GMing process and how this can be used to inform the design of a computational assistant for GMs.","2021-08","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-10-15 04:05:36","","01-08","","","","","","Story Improvisation in Tabletop Roleplaying Games","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2325-4289","","","","_procedural storytelling; _GMing; _improvisation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _ux","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"FH5DK9VR","journalArticle","2022","Giordano, Michael J.","Legitimate Peripheral Participation by Novices in a Dungeons and Dragons Community","Simulation & Gaming","","1046-8781","10.1177/10468781221119829","https://doi.org/10.1177/10468781221119829","IntroductionDungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a cooperative tabletop roleplaying game in which players gather together to tell stories. Expert players have a wealth of experiences and game knowledge from which to draw upon while playing the game. Novices, on the other hand, have little experience to depend on when navigating the first few gaming sessions.ObjectivesThe primary objective of this investigation was to describe how different novices become socialized to the D&D culture in this small community at the beginning of a new gaming campaign.MethodsThe present study is a cross-sectional qualitative participant observation of D&D novice socialization through the lens of communities of practice (CoP). Observation and interviews of two experts and five novice fifth edition D&D players revealed interactions and choices made by players related to the dissemination of cultural and practical knowledge and the fluidity of player and character identity within the scope of observed gameplay.ResultsThe results showed that for some novices explicit in-game training was required to learn their role at the table, but socialization could come more quickly for novices who took extra steps to gain experience by engaging in the wider distributed and virtual community through online forums or viewing streamed actual-play D&D games. Three interaction types?player-to-player, player-to-dungeon master (DM), and character-to-character?for three distinct purposes?understanding game mechanics, describing scenes, and interacting in narrative?were observed. Additionally, the character choices regarding gender and in-game actions were explored.ConclusionThe cooperative nature of D&D can afford novices explicit training from expert players at the table. However, as was observed during the game and confirmed in the interviews, socialization into this D&D gaming community also came from legitimate peripheral participation of the novices who engaged in the wider, virtual D&D community through online forums, actual-play streams and podcasts, and general knowledge of the fantasy genre.","2022-10-01","2022-09-21 16:23:21","2022-11-05 00:54:31","2022-09-11 01:30:30","446-469","","5","53","","Simulation & Gaming","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","_assessment; _group dynamics; _dnd; _collaborative; _interview; _new player; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _empirical work; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, Japanese high school students of the author have expressed dissatisfaction that they only became comfortable in the setting in the latter part of their study abroad trip and that they felt the former half was “wasted time” as they struggled to interact. This project details the development of a role-playing game (RPG) designed to expose students to various real-life scenarios likely to be encountered on a study abroad trip (Australia in this case). Previous research has shown that role-play and simulations can prepare students for real-life situations (Hofstede et al., 2010), and gamification can increase motivation (Monterrat et al., 2017). This game uses the theoretical framework of Nicholson’s (2012) RECIPE for meaningful gamification (Reflection, Exposition, Choice, Information, Play, Engagement). The initial pilot study will run over ten one-hour sessions once a week after school, prior to departure. Students create a player character (PC) and decide several goals they aim to achieve during the game. Connecting via Discord, a student from the partner school in Australia acts as the game master (GM) and leads a group of 3-4 students through the various scenes, describing what is around and playing the role of all non-player characters (NPCs). Images, maps, and other realia are shared on Discord to provide the PCs with context. PCs can freely interact with objects and NPCs based on their goals and interests. A heavy focus on reflection/debriefing allows students to re-evaluate situations and discuss practical ways to overcome difficulties. Discord saves all shared data so students can freely review aspects between sessions. Upon return from abroad, student feedback will be used to improve scenarios and add relevant interactions based on the real-life struggles of students.","2022-06-19","2022-09-22 15:03:12","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-09-13 13:17:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tokyo","en","","","","","","","","","","","_language learning; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though the manner in which adults engage in such play is notably different from children, and has been termed “Pretensive Shared Reality” (PSR). A central question regarding PSR is that of the degree to which the ‘cognitive quarantine’ (Nichols and Stich, 2000) is permeable. We examine the degree of permeability between real and fictive identities, and establish a novel ‘cognitive porousness’ scale. We also established the degree to which theoretically relevant factors, such as enjoyment and engagement, influence porousness. We report that there is a notable degree of cognitive porousness between players' personal identities and their characters’ identity when players responded, via their character, to fantasy-theme moral dilemmas. Furthermore, we found that engagement influenced the degree of permeation while enjoyment appeared to have no impact. This research demonstrates the tractability of examining adult pretence from a quantitative and cognitive perspective.","2022-08-19","2022-09-22 15:07:28","2024-02-09 15:49:31","2022-08-29 13:44:31","","","","","","","Cognitive Permeation between the real and the imagined","","","","","OSF Preprints","","en","","","","","OSF Preprints","","","","","","_creativity; _pretend play; _identity; _dnd; _moral play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _distantiation; _empirical work; _PSYCHOLOGY","Psychology; Cognitive Psychology; Social and Behavioral Sciences; imagination; Social Psychology; cognitive quarantine; Community Psychology; identity fusion; Life Sciences; morality; pretence; pretensive shared reality; Quantitative Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is this notion of animation that mobilizes this paper on Jesse Ross's tabletop roleplaying game Trophy Dark (2021), and which informed my own experience as simultaneous game facilitator and game design instructor for a class of fifteen undergraduate students. With a group split roughly in half between students with varying levels of experience with Dungeons & Dragons (and solely Dungeons & Dragons) and students with no tabletop roleplaying experience whatsoever, Trophy Dark, and specifically Ross's incursion ""Witchwood,"" made for a group exercise in this animative witness to the ""not ours"" and ""not us"" of which Stengers writes. Rather than adopting a rationalist, critical separation from the play experience, or a romantic, reflective immersion in the play experience, this particular group of students discovered in Trophy Dark a vehicle for the ""active,"" ""transformative,"" and indeed ""metamorphic"" experience that Stengers describes, using the chosen incursion as an instrument for the shared dramatic failure that is ""playing to lose,"" as advocated in Trophy Dark's player's guide. Stengers awakens her readers to a ""rhizomatic"" materialism, or a materialism of the ""milieu,"" and together in the Witchwood we encountered the same.

Traditional table-top roleplaying games (TTRPG) such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) and Warhammer are well known for their immersive phenomenological narrative experiences (White, 2014) and engaging analogue interaction with tangible game pieces (Liu et al, 2021). MR offers new ways of building on these elements to enhance the immersive and haptic interactive gameplay experience while retaining the popular elements of TTRPGs.

Emerging in the late 1980s, cybertext literature has reshaped narrative storytelling with the arrival of the technology of links and nodes which opened the way towards video games with a focus on reading and narrative. This shift has blurred the lines between traditional printed literature and digital literature, complicating and revising the way we categorize literary texts. Through the analysis of different types of printed and digital cybertext literary works - namely Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves, Milorad Pavić’s Dictionary of the Khazars, Austin Jorgensen’s Lisa, ZA/UM’s Disco Elysium,  Ice-Pick Lodge’s Pathologic, Obsidian Entertainment’s Fallout: New Vegas, 11 Bit Studios’ This War of Mine and Electronic Arts’ The Sims - this thesis aims to provide insight into the dynamic relationship between cybertexts and their readers and into the way narrative meaning is conveyed through the way the reader is conditioned to traverse the text. Relying on the work of narratologists and cybertext theorists, this paper uses taxonomies of multimodal fiction to illustrate connections between printed and digital works and the distinctions in the way different types of readers and players can be constructed within a participatory narrative framework. Analysis of both printed and digital cybertext literature in this thesis provides insight into the three types of focalising perspectives or three types of cybertext readers - the doubly-deictic reader, the reader-as-protagonist and the omniscient multimodal perspective. As the analysis shows, two of the three focalising perspectives occur both in printed and in digital iterations of cybertext literature, with the third occurring only in digital literature. The final aim of this work is thus to demonstrate ways in which these focalising perspectives function in cybertext literature, as well as to convey the need for further analysis of cybertext readers in order to better understand the overlapping and intersecting categories of reader and player.","2022-09-16","2022-09-27 13:43:08","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-09-27 13:43:08","","","","","","","Players and Readers","","","","","University of Zagreb.

Despite selling over 250 million copies worldwide and becoming the fourth most popular children's series of all time, the CYOA phenomenon has yet to be placed in its larger social, economic, historical or cultural context. When explaining the rise of interactive narratives, previous literature has mostly focussed on technological change – namely the invention of video games, computer consoles and hypertext narratives. Moving away from such claims, this article demonstrates how the incredible success of solely text-based CYOA books stemmed largely from the cultural ascent of individual market choice to the heart of American notions of agency, liberty, subjectivity and selfhood in the 1970s and 1980s.","2021-05","2022-09-27 13:55:58","2022-10-20 01:48:39","2021-10-21 16:35:24","418-445","","2","55","","","Rearing Children of the Market in the “You” Decade","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press QID: Q114269853","","","","_major publication; _story vs game; _agency; _history; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _CYOA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as a literary phenomenon, hypertext novels have remained marginal. The article presents some scientifically derived explanations as to why hypertext novels do not have a mass audience and why they are likely to remain a marginal contribution in the history of literature. Three explanatory frameworks are provided: (1) how hypertext relates to our cognitive information processing in general; (2) the empirically derived psychological reasons for how we read and enjoy literature in particular; and (3) the likely evolutionary origins of such a predilection for storytelling and literature. It is shown how hypertext theory, by ignoring such knowledge, has yielded misguided statements and uncorroborated claims guided by ideology rather than by scientifically supported knowledge.","2017-04-01","2022-09-27 13:55:58","2022-10-15 04:19:39","2017-11-01 13:54:16","166-181","","2","23","","Convergence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","","","","","_literature; _reading; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _CYOA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pourtant, ces récits à embranchements ont de nombreux points communs avec certains genres de jeux vidéo qui mettent l’accent sur les choix significatifs du joueur et sur l’impact qu’ils ont sur la ligne narrative et l’univers de fiction. Le concept d’expérientialité, issu de la narratologie cognitive, permet d’éclairer le fonctionnement commun à ces deux formats : si le propre d’un récit est de se construire autour d’une expérience subjective inscrite dans le temps, il découle qu’un récit disjonctif tendra naturellement à se construire autour de la notion du libre-arbitre. La mise en scène du choix et de son impact est à ce titre plus importante que la réelle marge de manœuvre laissée au joueur : c’est le ressenti expérientiel qui prime dans cette narrativité du choix., In the family tree of video games, gamebooks are often overlooked. Yet these arborescent narratives have much in common with certain types of video games that emphasize the significant choices made by the player and the impact they have on the storyline and the fictional universe. The concept of experientiality, as developed by cognitive narratology, may help to clarify the mechanisms shared by these two formats : if narratives are built around a subjective experience unfolding through time, then the natural tendency of disjunctive narratives will be to build themselves around the notion of free will. In this regard, the staging of choice and of its impact is more important than the actual degree of leeway left to the player : the experiential aspects are paramount in this narrativity of choice.","2018-05-28","2022-09-27 13:55:58","2022-10-15 04:18:04","2018-08-02 14:07:14","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","fr","Tous droits réservés","","","","journals.openedition.org","","","","","","_storytelling; _agency; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _CYOA; _computer rpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I use Pierre Bourdieu’s (1984) theory of habitus to create the notion of what I call DM habitus, or “deeply engrained habits, skills, and bodily dispositions” that result from the gaming experience that individuals in the Dungeon Master role enact to cement their role. I discuss how, instead of affirmative lines between the idea of “collaborator,” “storyteller,” and “divinity,” the authority granted to Dungeon Masters by the space of social production of tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs) provides them the ability to appropriate these distinct roles for the sake of preserving the social structure of the gaming space.","2022-09-30","2022-09-30 09:33:36","2024-03-18 18:28:10","2022-09-30 09:33:36","03-13","","3","","","","DM Habitus","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2022 Steven Dashiell","","","","jarps.net","","Number: 3 QID: Q114713324","","","","_dnd; _GMing; _peer reviewed; _SOCIOLOGY; _theoretical work; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =MF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Just as these movements have challenged enduring inequalities that limit the realization of minority members’ agency in the public domain, many new games insist that it is not merely troubling content that may give people pause from engaging in the role-playing hobby. Rather, many of these games reconsider the structure of conventional play itself, in which one individual holds asymmetrical power to influence the narrative, echoing other asymmetrical (and even unjust) hierarchies at large in society. These games demonstrate that this central figure is not necessary for evocative play and a group’s imaginative capabilities. Games without a Game Master, “GMless'' games, often aim to expand avenues of creative input and liberate a table from the aegis of a single member’s directorial aesthetics. This essay claims that social justice movements have had an influence on the outpouring of GMless game designs in the last half-decade. Further, this essay identifies several conventional responsibilities associated with the role of the Game Master, illustrating how a variety of published GMless designs in both, larps and TRPGs, reimagine, remix, and reincorporate these responsibilities, making possible more egalitarian and—for many—more welcoming roleplaying experiences.","2022-09-30","2022-09-30 09:33:36","2022-10-17 02:54:49","2022-09-30 09:33:36","70-81","","3","","","","<エッセイ>神々も支配者もいない --非促進型(GMなし)デザイン枠組みの概要","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2022 Ben Bisogno","","","","jarps.net","","Number: 3 QID: Q114713323","","","","_peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _GMless; =cleaned; =MF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the role of the game master (GM) in facilitating conversation has not been examined. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively examined the relationship between the GM's comments during TRPG activities and the participant children's statements. Using conversation analysis methods, we examined the effectiveness of GM interventions in assisting children with ASD to proceed with conversations voluntarily and cooperatively. The results showed that the GM, as one of the participants, provided effective suggestions for the children to proceed with the game.

Enchantment is a key term in “On Fairy-stories.” In it, Tolkien describes the enchantment of fairies that “produces a Secondary World into which both the designer and spectator can enter, to the satisfaction of their senses while they are inside”. Wargaming served as an important backdrop to the development of the mechanics of fantasy gaming. The latest step in the evolution of Tolkien's ideas and worlds into games took place when the Internet spread wide enough that a whole generation of players sought to reinstate this camaraderie that the RPG experience lost in migrating to the computer.","2022","2022-10-03 15:42:01","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-10-03 15:19:14","511-524","","","","","","","","","","","John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","Section: 40 _eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9781119691457.ch40 DOI: 10.1002/9781119691457.ch40","","","","_literature; _wargame; _card game; _tolkien; _adaptation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _encyclopedia","On Fairy-stories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Much of the research on autism has been conducted in laboratories with individual research participants or in contexts where people on the autism spectrum represent a small and problematized minority among nonautistic people—trends that risk essentializing the stereotype of people with autism as fundamentally estranged from sociality, by nature at odd angles with shared culture. The book takes a different approach: It is based on ethnographic fieldwork in communities where people on the autism spectrum come together. Such spaces tend to assemble people who are affected by autism in a variety of ways: people who have the diagnosis, people who have interests in common with people who have the diagnosis, family members, professionals who have chosen to dedicate much of their professional lives to autism, and others as well. The book chronicles the ways in which youth on the autism spectrum make sense of life under the description of autism. It explores the origins and implications of this paradox: How does such an irreducibly social, cultural, and interpersonal phenomenon as autism come to connote the absence of sociality, relationality, and interpersonal significance? What kind of cultural meaning-work gets done through this transformation? In doing so, the book also explores the ground on which much of this work takes place: the contested terrain of the human brain.

Ces développements ont mené à un vaste ensemble de concepts, qu’il est parfois difficile de bien cerner. Ils appellent ainsi aujourd’hui à une prise de recul et à une meilleure vue d’ensemble. Une boussole revient aux fondements théoriques du jeu de rôle afin de : 1. fournir une porte d’entrée pour l’exploration de ces réflexions et concepts ; 2. clarifier les débats et éviter les contre-sens sur ce qu’est une théorie pour le jeu de rôle et ce qu’on l’on peut en attendre ; 3. proposer des pistes pour explorer de nouvelles formes de jeux de rôle, dans la création comme dans la pratique, et ainsi améliorer la pratique du jeu de rôle dans son ensemble. Plus largement, il s’agit d’encourager et de cultiver l’envie d’autres choses, d’autres jeux de rôle, d’autres pratiques. Il s’agit de pouvoir penser des futurs désirables pour le jeu de rôle et de travailler à leur concrétisation.","2022-08-24","2022-10-05 13:38:07","2022-10-05 14:27:59","2022-10-05 13:38:07","","141","","","","","","","","","","L'Alcyon","","fr","","","","","","","","","","","_rpg theory; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Retour sur la campagne médiatique contre le jeu de rôle au milieu des années 90","","978-2-490-80733-8","","","","Vers la fin du vingtième siècle, le tout jeune loisir ludique qu’est le jeu de rôle sur table – apparu vingt ans plus tôt – est victime d’une sorte de « chasse aux sorcières » médiatique en France, se focalisant, sans grande objectivité et sans grande réflexion, sur des faits divers certes sordides (crimes, suicides, sectes…) auxquels la pratique du jeu de rôle est associée - à tort ou à raison. Les parents s’émeuvent, les pouvoirs publics municipaux retirent subventions et locaux aux associations de rôlistes, le chiffre d’affaires des boutiques spécialisées baisse, certains éditeurs sont en difficulté… Malgré sa dispersion et son manque d’expérience, la communauté rôliste se mobilise et surmontera finalement ces temps difficiles, en s’appuyant entre autres, sur la création d’une fédération, la pugnacité des revues dont Casus Belli et son rédacteur en chef Didier Guiserix qui publiera également un ouvrage grand public et, de manière plus inattendue, la publication de la première étude française sur le jeu de rôle par… un officier de gendarmerie : Jean-Hugues Matelly, certes également rôliste. Dans « Jeu de Rôle », il prend le parti de reprendre point par point toutes les accusations alors portées contre le jeu de rôle et de démontrer, ici leur exagération, là, leur invraisemblance, à l’aide des outils de la criminologie, de la sociologie voire de la philosophie. Il est également le premier à tenter de positionner le jeu de rôle dans les grandes théories existantes sur le jeu, démontrant qu’il est une nouvelle forme ludique reposant sur des mécanismes de base qui fondent tous les jeux. Un quart de siècle plus tard, la présente réédition de l’ouvrage de 1997 est augmentée d’une postface de l’auteur, revenant sur les circonstances et le contexte d’écriture de l’ouvrage, sur son accueil et au-delà sur quelques réflexions d’un « vieux » rôliste.","2022","2022-10-08 03:53:12","2022-10-13 02:19:57","","","228","","","","","","Études","1","","","Posidonia Editions","","fr","","","","","","","","","","","_moral panic; _france; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This practice-research initiative produced ten 60‐90-minute role-playing games conducted on the social media platform WhatsApp. In the process, we worked to identify and refine design strategies that incentivize engagement with the type of narrative collaboration that media scholars commonly call ‘collective storytelling’. Via the participatory action research methodology, this study evolved through cycles of prototyping, testing, feedback, reflection and modification. This article analyses our study in relation to the ‘Threefold Word Model’ for RPGs proposed by Kim. Based on the affordances of the WhatsApp interface, we suggest a modification of this conceptual frame, in line with scholars such as Edwards, Bøckman and Bowman that extends investigations into four theoretical lenses that we use to examine the stories in our study. These modes are (1) drama, (2) game, (3) simulation and (4) immersion. The observations made also suggest new avenues for ‘writing’ and creating interactive digital narratives.","2022-07-01","2022-10-10 02:39:26","2023-09-18 14:15:38","","207-230","","2","13","","Journal of Screenwriting","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IngentaConnect","","","","","","_immersion; _simulation; _group dynamics; _collaborative; _rpg theory; _remote; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _EMOTIONS; _GAMEPLAY","role-playing games; participatory action research; collaboration; digital storytelling; interactive narratives; WhatsApp","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"XT7BB2BJ","thesis","2022","Ball, Graham","A Phenomenological Inquiry into the Therapeutic Aspects of Tabletop Roleplaying Games","","","","","https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/OutputFile/10020041","Table-top Role Playing Games (RPGs) have risen in popularity since their conception in the 1970’s. While some literature has explored their emergent psychological processes, very few studies have explicitly reflected on the therapeutic potential of these games, particularly from a phenomenological perspective. In this study, views, perceptions, and experiences of eight UK-based players were gathered through semi-structured interviews assisted by multi-modal diaries. These interviews were then transcribed and analysed through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The analysis settled on two superordinate themes. ‘Symbolic Play’ consisted of two sub-themes: ‘Expression Through Play’, which captured participants’ idiosyncratic experiences of projecting fears, fantasies, desires, and taboos onto their characters; and ‘Working Through Difficulties’, which illustrates how players symbolically navigate their past experiences, or current difficulties through their character and the worlds they co-produce. The second superordinate theme ‘When Players Come Together’ also embodied two sub-themes: ‘Playing In Person Helps with Immersion’, which explored the experience of moving to online play from face-to-face as a result of the COVID-19 social restrictions, highlighting the importance of intimacy and physical proximity when playing in person; and ‘When Things Fall Apart: The Significance and Perils of the Group’, which examined conflicts the participants experienced as part of the role playing group, exploring what is counter-therapeutic in an attempt to provide an answer to what is therapeutic. I conclude by arguing that tabletop role-playing games play stage to profoundly therapeutic processes such as play, symbolism, containment, mirroring, and witnessing as they show us how players relate to themselves and the group. Strengths and limitations of the study are examined before arriving at some tentative 6 recommendations regarding the value of role-playing vis-à-vis therapeutic growth, amongst other implications of the study. Reflexive commentary is offered throughout the thesis in an attempt to both bracket and pay attention to the phenomenology of the researcher, which has contributed to the double hermeneutic of sense-making in this research.","2022","2022-10-11 18:14:41","2022-10-13 02:19:41","","","170","","","","","","","","","","University of the West of England, Bristol","Bristol","en","","PhD Counselling Psychology","","","","","","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _empirical work; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Game to Grow Method of Therapeutically Applied Role-Playing Games is a transdiagnostic, transtheoretical, group intervention developed over a decade of practice using Dungeons & Dragons and other popular tabletop role-playing game systems, as well as leveraging therapeutic factors from acceptance and commitment therapy, marriage and family therapy, drama therapy, and interpersonal process groups. TA-RPGs are conceptualized as a gaming system layered on top of established intervention techniques. They can accommodate a multitude of game systems and align with theoretical mechanisms for change found across therapeutic orientations.

One place this comes into play is in games where players play the role of a character other than themselves. This thesis looks specifically at analog games and examines the way that game rules shape players’ ability to explore identity and social interaction through the game. I argue that game rules in these games help determine what questions players ask themselves and what kinds of interaction they explore. To better understand these types of games I look at the rules of a specific LARP, Dystopia Rising, and a specific tabletop game, Shadowrun, in detail in order to better understand how these rules have the potential to shape players exploration of identity and interaction.","2017","2022-10-16 00:49:50","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2022-10-16 00:25:18","","56","","","","","Not Just Roleplay","","","","","University of Toronto","Toronto","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Master Information Science","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9780355450064","","","","_identity; _fandom; _layout; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While some lectures may fail to achieve this goal due to monotone, routine speeches or uninteresting PowerPoint presentations, educational live action role-playing (edu-larp) is a strategy to facilitate interactive and engaged learning. Edu-larp is catching the attention of an increasing number of teachers, both in secondary schools and higher education. This article introduces edu-larp and its unique benefits by summarizing past research results and providing theoretical support for edu-larp through experiential learning theory. A sample lesson plan is also included. The lesson plan exemplifies how to utilize edu-larp to teach the importance and benefits of public parks to university students.

Across the globe, video games and interactive media have already been granted their own departments at numerous larger institutions and will increasingly fall under the purview of language and literature departments at smaller schools. This volume considers fundamental ways in which literature can be construed as a game and the benefits of such an approach. The contributors outline pedagogical strategies for integrating the study of video games with the study of literature and consider the intersections of identity and ideology as they relate to literature and ludology. They also address the benefits (and liabilities) of making the process of learning itself a game, an approach that is quickly gaining currency and increasing interest. Every chapter is grounded in theory but focuses on practical applications to develop students' critical thinking skills and intercultural competence through both digital and analog gameful approaches.","2022-09-22","2022-10-18 20:41:07","2022-10-30 02:13:31","","177-184","","","","","","","","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","London","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: TPl8EAAAQBAJ","","","","_literature; _cinema; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING","","Pugh, Tison; Ramey, Lynn","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, I place larping within the larger context of leisure subcultures and society by arguing that larping is representative of changes in leisure and subcultures in postmodern society. Second, I draw upon ethnographic data collected among the New England Role-playing Organization (NERO) to analyze larpers character identity performances. RPG and Larp researchers have developed several theories about the relationship between larp participants and their character performances. While these concepts provide a helpful framework for understanding the participant-character relationship, they undertheorize the in-game constructed performance of identity. Using symbolic interaction theory, I analyze the identity work processes larpers use to construct and perform their larp identities extending our understanding of the similarities between everyday identity and larpers' character identity performances.","2022-01-01","2022-10-18 20:43:49","2022-10-30 02:12:33","2022-10-18 20:43:49","167-189","","","54","","","Becoming an Ogre","Studies in Symbolic Interaction","","","","Emerald Publishing Limited","","","","","","","Emerald Insight","","DOI: 10.1108/S0163-239620220000054009","","","","_identity; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","T.

However, online platforms have some drawbacks and limitations in various aspects, for example, in embodiment, in accessibility, etc. This thesis aims to gain deeper insights into factors influencing players in terms of embodiment during online LARPing and important features that future online LARP designers should pay attention to. This thesis is a qualitative research aiming to create design guidelines through empirical investigations of online LARPing. For the empirical investigations, the study embraced an ethnographic approach through participatory observations, complimented by analysis of scripts and interviews with writers. The study then used the findings from the empirical investigations to understand what make players feel more embodied during an online LARPing and let the results inform the creation of design guidelines that could bring a higher degree of embodiment to online LARPing. The work is mainly a design proposal or a design guidance intended for future online LARP designers, instead of building a new technology or a new prototype. The design guidelines aim to create comprehensive recommendations to bring out more embodiment while LARPing online.","2022","2022-10-19 14:43:28","2024-02-09 15:51:34","2022-10-19 14:41:51","","20","","","","","Embodiment in Online LARPing","","","","","Uppsala University","Uppsala","en","","Master Informatics and Media","","","www.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_virtual table; _embodiment; =cleaned; _LARP; _DESIGN; _designing rpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ziel der Studie war es, herauszufinden, inwiefern in den Medien gängige Vorurteile gegenüber Spielern von Pen & Paper-Rollenspielen gerechtfertigt sind. Dafür wurden Maße für die Big Five, Risikobereitschaft, Autoritarismus und Intelligenz erhoben. Weiterhin wurden allgemeine Motive sowie Motive für das Spielen von Pen & Paper-Rollenspielen erfasst. Die Hypothesen besagten unter Anderem, dass Spieler entgegen gängiger Vorurteile keine höhere Ausprägung auf dem Merkmal Neurotizismus zeigen würden, dass ihre Risikobereitschaft während des Spielens höher als außerhalb des Spiels sein würde und dass gemeinschaftliche Motive beim Spielen von Pen & Paper- Rollenspielen im Vordergrund stehen würden. Mit Hilfe von t-Tests zeigte sich kein Unterschied bezüglich der Merkmale Neurotizismus und Verträglichkeit. Die Merkmale Offenheit für Erfahrungen sowie Extraversion waren bei Pen & Paper-Rollenspielern stärker ausgeprägt als in der Vergleichsstichprobe, Gewissenhaftigkeit war schwächer ausgeprägt. Weiterhin schnitten die Spieler in einem Intelligenztest besser ab und zeigten niedrigere Werte für das Merkmal Autoritarismus.

There is a gap in existing scholarship in this area, but the research that is available suggests that TTRPGs are likely to present LGBT+ themes in a manner that is biased to its authors views. This thesis aims to determine the ways in which TTRPGs engage with LGBT+ identities within their rulebooks, and the ways in which TTRPG players construct their LGBT+ characters as a result. This study utilises mixed methods research, combining analysis of rulebooks focused on queer theory and ludology, and a survey of existing TTRPG players in order to achieve the aims set out above. The result of this research primarily discusses a demographic of young, queer adults who have consistently played as at least one LGBT+ character within a TTRPG. Overall, this study found that indicates that the construction of LGBT+ identities within TTRPGs is ultimately a collaborative effort between the rules as written, and the player’s actionable usage of them within a game. With regards to the fluff reality of the game, this meant that players typically ignored game content in favour of creating their own, personalised lore to match their ideal game world. With regards to the mechanical reality of the game, this instead meant that, while rulebooks could provide a clear overview of the author’s intent towards the place of queer content within their game design, players could purposefully choose to ignore any information provided by the game, as they functioned as the final authority on what rules were allowed within the game.","2021","2022-10-19 14:57:14","2022-10-19 15:02:24","2022-10-19 14:56:22","","110","","","","","","","","","","Sheffield Hallam University","Sheffield","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798835540808","","","","_identity; _lgbtq; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using interviews conducted with 50 participants who reported playing the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons or the digital roleplaying game World of Warcraft and my own experience of games I present evidence and develop theory in existing literature on 3 major axes. The first is women and marginalized identities' participation in the game space. I detail the ways in which women have participated in not only the play of these games since their inception but also how they have held key roles in the development of roleplaying games. The second is how white, male-identified players navigate rule systems based on unexamined, racist assumptions about rules which are in conflict with their understandings of race. Additionally, I discuss the ways in which players who are subject to cultural ‘othering’ in their lived experiences embrace even further othered bodies in virtual spaces. The third articulates a theory about how gamers have thrown open the ""gates"" of the pastime, but practice mostly at ""kitchen tables"" which are highly exclusive which creates a divide between the public ""face"" of gaming, and it's private ""heart."" These smaller groups operate simultaneously to the larger discourses on the public face of gaming. In these spaces, players can control their environment, who they game with, and thus create safe gaming spaces where they do not have to confront toxic or aggressive discourses in the larger gaming community. Using this I add nuance to larger theories of cultural practice communities which opt instead of forming hierarchies dependent on the ‘right’ way to do things of self-definition and ousting players who do not fit at their tables.","2022","2022-10-20 17:48:28","2022-10-30 02:09:39","2022-10-20 17:45:49","","142","","","","","Roles of the Dice","","","","","University of Oregon","Eugene","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. in Sociology","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798352934258","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _gender; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _computer rpg; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The games themselves, as well as the gaming subculture, offer players a number of personal and social benefits that continue to enrich their lives long after they leave the table. Using Goffman's theories of Dramaturgy and Frame Analysis, this paper seeks to examine the positive impact of gaming in three key areas. The first is an analysis of the subculture which includes the evolution of the games, the growth and diversification of the roleplaying community, and the current shift in stereotypes about gaming. The second section discusses the ways in which microcultural worlds are created, with an emphasis on the systematic alignment of group frames, different types of emotional and social crossover that occurs, and the conveyance of status. The final segment describes the processes that create engrossment and identification in the games. It focuses on the balance of the three frameworks used in fantasy creation, types of physical aids used to bridge fantasy and reality, relationships that exist between players and their characters, and the negotiation of role conflict that arises from maintaining multiple roles simultaneously. The benefits players gain from roleplaying are diverse. It provides socialization and recreational enjoyment, improves role negotiation and impression management, allows players to experience elements that are beyond their reality, creates a safe environment to test new elements of identity, promotes creative problem solving, and builds critical thinking.","2012","2022-10-20 17:51:24","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","78","","","","","","","","","","University of Arkansas","Fayetteville","en","","MA Sociology","","","Zotero","","","","","","_fandom; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At a time of renewed interest in analogue gaming, as scholars are looking beyond the digital and virtual for the first time since the inception of game studies in the 1990s, Material Game Studies not only supports the importance of the (re)turn to the analogue, but proposes a materiality of play more broadly.  Recognizing the entanglement of physical materiality with cultural meaning, the authors in this volume apply a range of theoretical approaches, from material eco-criticism to animal studies, to examine games and play as existing within worlds of matter. Different chapters focus on the material properties of board, card and role-playing games, how they are designed and made, how they are touched and played with, and how they connect with other human and nonhuman things.  Bringing together international scholars, Material Game Studies defines a new field of material game studies and demonstrates how it is a valuable addition to wider debates about the material turn and the place of embodied humans in a material world.","2022-11-03","2022-10-22 00:25:51","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","265","","","","","Material Game Studies","","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ZauVEAAAQBAJ","","","","_philosophy; _anthropology; _politics; _layout; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _DESIGN; _MEDIA; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The failure or success of every action and the making of every player character (the stats and backstory of the characters are rolled and fleshed out in pre-production phases) is often determined by luck of the draw (dice roll, card draw…), thanks to the rules provided by the TTRPG system of choice (in most cases Dungeons & Dragons 5e). The system allows for Dungeon Masters (the players that run the game and consequently the story) to step out of the rules set and change the impact of some dice rolls, allowing the chance of a natural 20 on D20 roll to completely restructure the narrative of the story. Is this rolling of the die aspect and more important natural 20s and 1s where this study will focus, trying to comprehend how special they really are and how much impact they can have in the result of the show.","2022-09-21","2022-10-22 00:35:38","2023-08-23 12:53:30","2022-10-22 00:34:24","552-558","","","","","","Critical Success: The narrative weight of chance in TTRPG based shows (actual play)","","","","","","","es","Direitos de Autor (c) 2022 AVANCA | CINEMA","","","","publication.avanca.org","","","","","","_dice; _actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and in-depth qualitative interviews with 24 AP producers, it maps out relational networks with key actors that give shape to AP, including the TRPG industry, major brands like Critical Role and Dungeons & Dragons, online distribution platforms, co-production networks, and audiences.  This account of the field undergirds an analysis of AP production as labour. The analysis indicates that AP producers are aware of the structural economic limitations of their craft, and underscores the importance of non-economic values, such as cultural participation, enjoyment, and community, in motivating their work. Despite AP's deep imbrication in processes of commodification and neoliberal structuration, this research speaks to its embeddedness in parallel economies of affect and play. The concluding chapter connects AP to broader evolutions in the creative economy, namely ubiquitous commodification and platformization of cultural production, and argues for the necessity of multilayered analyses of labour that are sensitive to questions of pleasure, community, and coping, as significant dimensions in the political economy of cultural production.","2022-05-19","2022-10-22 00:55:05","2022-10-30 01:08:11","2022-10-22 00:54:46","","197","","","","","Producing Play","","","","","York University","York","en","Author owns copyright, except where explicitly noted.

Pour comprendre ce genre, il est nécessaire d’en faire l’histoire pour en lire l’évolution à travers le temps. Or, une simple lecture historique ne parvient que très partiellement à restituer un portrait d’ensemble de ce type de jeu vidéo. À partir de notions de genre, de jeu de rôle et d’histoire, ce mémoire dresse un bilan historiographique du RPG ainsi que de ses écritures. Ce bilan permet de dégager les enjeux principaux qui ont articulé l’histoire du jeu de rôle numérique, enjeux qui sont ensuite soumis à une enquête historique. Cette enquête menée sur la critique de jeu vidéo dans des magazines spécialisés entre 1980 et 2006 permet de restituer l’état des lieux à une époque donnée et de le comparer aux écrits des historiens du genre. À la lumière de ces résultats, ce mémoire documente, précise et nuance l’histoire du jeu de rôle telle que construite par les historiens et offre une vision plus actuelle du jeu de rôle numérique d’hier à aujourd’hui.","2022-03-16","2022-10-22 00:57:26","2022-10-30 02:11:15","2022-10-22 00:55:34","","137","","","","","Revoir l’histoire du jeu de rôle numérique comme genre vidéoludique","","","","","Université de Montréal","Montreal","fr","","MA Études cinématographiques","","","papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca","","Accepted: 2022-04-12T15:42:41Z","","","","_canada; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _united states; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The dynamics process was recorded chronologically, with mapping of the participants’ difficulties, points of interest and, at the end, the characters were evaluated for the consistency with which they were constructed and the groups for their work during the dynamics.

The players utilize identity typifications, construct characters, and manage costuming and appearance to create fantasy identities situated in a role play environment. This role play environment is also one of multiple realities with borders that must be symbolically managed by participants so as to separate the fantasy frame from that of the everyday frame.

We then draw parallels between posthuman qualitative research into sound (via noise) and the ideological foundation of experimental music, a musical tradition deeply invested in working with sound as an agentic actor. Within this alignment, we propose using graphic scores to transcribe sonic data without reinscribing humanist research aims. To illustrate, we provide a micro-analysis of preservice teachers engaged in a role-playing game activity and uncover the ways sound asserts its agency within learning ecologies.","2022-10-28","2022-10-31 20:08:23","2023-09-18 14:13:36","2022-10-31 20:05:14","1-14","","0","0","","Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education","Players Chatter and Dice Clatter","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","_group dynamics; _music; _conversation; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _ux; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet even while the comic book and hobby shops where the above are consumed today are seeing an influx of BIPOC gamers, they remain overwhelmingly white, male, and heterosexual. The Privilege of Play contends that in order to understand geek identity’s exclusionary tendencies, we need to know the history of the overwhelmingly white communities of tabletop gaming hobbyists that preceded it. It begins by looking at how the privileged networks of model railroad hobbyists in the early twentieth century laid a cultural foundation for the scenes that would grow up around war games, role-playing games, and board games in the decades ahead. These early networks of hobbyists were able to thrive because of how their leisure interests and professional ambitions overlapped. Yet despite the personal and professional strides made by individuals in these networks, the networks themselves remained cloistered and homogeneous—the secret playgrounds of white men. Aaron Trammell catalogs how gaming clubs composed of lonely white men living in segregated suburbia in the sixties, seventies and eighties developed strong networks through hobbyist publications and eventually broke into the mainstream. He shows us how early hobbyists considered themselves outsiders, and how the denial of white male privilege they established continues to define the socio-technical space of geek culture today. By considering the historical role of hobbyists in the development of computer technology, game design, and popular media, The Privilege of Play charts a path toward understanding the deeply rooted structural obstacles that have stymied a more inclusive community. The Privilege of Play concludes by considering how digital technology has created the conditions for a new and more diverse generation of geeks to take center stage.","2023","2022-11-04 14:40:33","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-11-04 14:39:39","","","","","","","The Privilege of Play","Postmillennial Pop","","","","New York University Press","New York","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","Publication Title: The Privilege of Play","","","","_boardgame; _wargame; _fandom; _gender; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of avatars can allow for what anthropologists call ecstasy , from the Greek ekstasis , meaning ""standing outside oneself."" The archaic techniques of promoting spiritual ecstasy, which remain central to religious healing traditions around the world, now also have contemporary analogues in virtual worlds found on the internet. In this innovative book, Jeffrey G.

Reenactment is a global phenomenon that ncompasses living history, historical reality television, performance art, theater, historically-informed music performance, experimental archeology, pilgrimage, battle reenactment, live-action role play, and other forms. These share a concern with simulating the past via authenticity, embodiment, affect, the performative and subjective. As such, reenactment constitutes a global form of popular historical knowledge-making, representation, and commemoration. Yet, in terms of its historical subject matter, styles, and subcultures, reenactment is often nationally or locally inflected. he book thus asks how domestic reenactment practices relate to global ones, as well as to the spread of new populisms, and postcolonial and decolonizing movements. he book is the first to address these questions through reenactment case studies drawn from various world regions. Forming a companion volume to the Reenactment Studies Handbook: Key Terms in the Field (2020), Reenactment Case Studies s aimed at a wide academic readership, especially in the fields of istory, film studies, memory studies, performance studies, museum and heritage studies, cultural and literary studies, and anthropology.","2022-12-16","2022-11-09 14:36:48","2022-11-09 14:40:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor & Francis","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: iMKZEAAAQBAJ DOI:10.4324/9780429445668-10","","","","_history; =cleaned; _LARP","","Agnew, Vanessa; Tomann, Juliane; Stach, Sabine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L’utilisation des jeux de rôle dans le but d’apprendre fait naturellement partie des initiatives liées à la ludopédagogie. Cependant, rares sont les projets portant sur l’enseignement (ils sont plutôt orientés sur la formation en entreprise). S’intéresser à l’efficacité de l’utilisation des jeux de rôle dans l’enseignement supérieur, et plus particulièrement dans le domaine du management, est donc une manière d’approfondir les applications déjà existantes de la ludopédagogie. Lors de la présentation du projet par M. Lépinard, chacun des membres du groupe a souhaité en découvrir davantage et étudier ces nouvelles techniques d’apprentissage. En effet, la ludopédagogie fait écho à nos diverses expériences en entreprise mais aussi à notre ambition de vouloir manager durant notre carrière professionnelle. D’autre part, certains membres du groupe étaient déjà familiarisés avec les jeux de rôle. Le projet “jeu de rôle en management” s’inscrit dans le cadre de nos études en première année de Master au sein de l’IAE Gustave Eiffel. Il est à l’origine de M. Lepinard qui avait déjà débuté des recherches et plus globalement du projet EdUTeam de l’Université ParisEst Créteil qui favorise la mise en place de projets ludopédagogiques. Nous avons cherché à comprendre les mécanismes d’apprentissage et les comportements managériaux pouvant surgir durant une séance de jeu de rôle afin de concevoir un “scénario type” permettant aux étudiants d’apprendre en s’amusant. Afin de répondre à ces questionnements, nous avons, tout au long du projet, mis en place des stratégies de recherche et d’expérimentation qui nous ont permis d’obtenir des éléments de réponse. Dans un premier temps, nous vous présenterons plus en détail la mise en place du projet puis son déroulement et nous terminerons par expliquer nos réalisations et les conclusions que nous en tirons.","2019","2022-11-10 19:45:05","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-11-10 16:27:53","","77","","","","","","","","","","IAE Gustave Eiffel","Paris","fr","","Mémoire projet collectif","","","","","","","","","_language learning; _leadership; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","Lépinard, Philippe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Soixante-dix étudiants ont pu bénéficier de cette modalité pédagogique. Les résultats issus des questionnaires anonymes montrent que l’impact, même s’il est négatif pour la majorité des critères évalués, est en définitive peu marqué.

Cette absence de dispositif technique supprime les contraintes intrinsèques à tout jeu vidéo et jeu de plateau. Ce sont les joueurs, avec l’aide d’un maître du jeu (MJ), qui vont co-concevoir l’histoire en s’appuyant sur quelques éléments de décors préalablement posés. L’improvisation narrative est la clé de ce type de jeu. Adossé à des logiques de gamification ou de game-based learning, les jeux de rôle sont de formidables vecteurs de discussion qui nécessitent un engagement important et obligatoire de la part des participants. On entrevoit les trois conditions de la motivation identifiées par la self-determination theory : l’autonomie, la compétence et les relations sociales (Deci & Ryan, 1985 ; 2000). Notre communication souhaite aborder un jeu en particulier : Eclipse Phase. L’histoire se déroule dans un monde post-apocalyptique où le perfectionnement humain via la technologie (transhumanisme) est devenu la règle.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are differences in the Big Five personality factors between Dungeons & Dragons players and non-players. Within a sample of 801 individuals – 399 Dungeons & Dragon players and 402 non-players - the results indicated that Dungeons & Dragons players show statistically significant higher scores in extraversion as well as in openness to new experiences. Furthermore, we found a statistically significant correlation between Dungeons & Dragons players’ scores in extraversion and their character’s charisma. The results are in line with more recent findings from Big Five research in the geek-culture and contradict older findings regarding a low extraversion and high neuroticism of Dungeons & Dragon players.","2022","2022-11-11 01:29:43","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-11-11 01:26:51","","","0","13","","","Do not make me roll initiative","","","","","","","en","","","","","Frontiers","","","","","","_personality; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =0.33; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _empirical work; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over time, many scholars have worked to describe, categorize, and measure these factors, to mixed success. All the while, similar types of groups have also been simultaneously yielding positive mental health benefits, while not receiving the same attention in the literature. One such type of group consists of those who gather for the purposes of playing tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). These games, which often involve imaginatively traversing planets, medieval kingdoms, or haunted forests, have been demonstrated to facilitate positive social and mental health outcomes in their players. Despite this, limited research has been done on the similarities between the two types of groups. Across two studies, I explored the specific factors of TTRPGs that players found to be helpful to their mental health. Responses were assessed using qualitative analysis and presented in the form of emergent themes, which were then subsequently compared with widely cited therapeutic factors of group therapy. Similarities and differences between group therapy and TTRPG groups are then discussed along with limitations of this study and directions for future research.","2022","2022-11-22 16:38:03","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2022-11-22 16:36:10","","152","","","","","Tabletop Therapy","","","","","Indiana University","Bloomington, IN","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. in Education","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798357557582","","","","_mental disorder; _therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ambos han tenido como función ayudar al desarrollo psicológico y cultural de los participantes, así como al desarrollo de historias que transmiten una serie de creencias, valores, conocimientos y filosofías. A finales del Siglo XX, se dio origen a una transversalidad entre juegos y narrativa, cuando obras como las del afamado Tolkien, Conan el Bárbaro de Robert E. Howard y ‎Fafhrd & the Gray Mouser de Frietz Leiber, entre otras, inspiran la creación de los primeros juegos de rol como Dungeons & Dragons. O la obra de Anne Rice y Bram Stoker inspiraro Vampiro la Mascarada. Esta transversalidad también va en el sentido opuesto, como con el caso de Record of Lodoss War, una serie de novelas ligeras japonesas por el diseñador de juegos Ryo Mizuno, en las cuales adapto inicialmente las aventuras de su grupo de Dungeons & Dragons, y que derivo en la creación de una franquicia que incluye juegos, anime y videojuegos. En esta transversalidad, es posible detectar tres herramientas que los juegos de rol pueden proveer al autor de novelas de género fantástico o de ciencia ficción: storytelling, worldbuilding y creación de personajes. El primer comparativo es entre las estructuras narrativas (como por ejemplo la estructura narrativa de tres arcos de Aristóteles o el ciclo de la historia de Dan Harmon) y el proceso narrativo o storytelling que sigue la planeación de una sesión o campaña de juego de rol. El segundo comparativo es entre el desarrollo del mundo la sesión o campaña de rol y el worldbuilding o creación de mundos, entre los cuales destacan las obras de Tolkien y G.R.R. Martin, así como los consejos de guías como Kobold, para darle un carácter de solidez al escenario en que la aventura se desarrolla. El tercer comparativo es entre la etapa de creación de personajes para una sesión de rol, y la creación del cast para una novela, analizando tópicos como pasado, habilidades, motivaciones, deseos, fortalezas y debilidades, que son algunos los elementos necesarios para la creación de personajes que sean atractivos para la audiencia. Esto se extiende incluso a videojuegos del tipo rol, como Final Fantasy (en particular el VI). Finalmente, se expondrá como se utilizaron estas tres herramientas del juego de rol durante el desarrollo de una serie de novelas de fantasía publicadas en 2019 y 2021. El objetivo de esta ponencia es presentar como los juegos de rol sirven como herramientas para el desarrollo de narrativas literarias de fantasía y ciencia ficción, desde la estructura de la historia, hasta la creación de personajes, pasando por la construcción de mundos detallados (mejor conocido como worldbuilding). Esto a través de comparativas con elementos de la narrativa anteriormente mencionados, como estructura de arco narrativos y de la experiencia personal de uno de los autores durante el desarrollo de dos novelas de fantasía publicadas en los pasados tres años. ENGLISH Storytelling, like play, has been part of human civilization since time immemorial. Both have had the function of helping the psychological and cultural development of the participants, as well as the development of stories that transmit a series of beliefs, values, knowledge and philosophies. At the end of the twentieth century, a transversality between games and narrative gave rise, when works such as those of the famous Tolkien, Conan the Barbarian by Robert E. Howard and Fafhrd & the Gray Mouser by Frietz Leiber, among others, inspire the creation of the first role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Or the work of Anne Rice and Bram Stoker inspired Vampire the Masquerade. This transversality also goes in the opposite direction, as with the case of Record of Lodoss War, a series of Japanese light novels by the game designer Ryo Mizuno, in which he initially adapted the adventures of his group of Dungeons & Dragons, and that resulted in the creation of a franchise that includes games, anime and video games. In this transversality, it is possible to detect three tools that role-playing games can provide to the author of fantasy or science fiction novels: storytelling, worldbuilding and character creation. The first comparison is between narrative structures (e.g. Aristotle's three-arc narrative structure or Dan Harmon's story cycle) and the narrative or storytelling process that follows the planning of a role-playing game session or campaign. The second comparison is between the development of the world, the role-playing session or campaign and the worldbuilding or creation of worlds, among which the works of Tolkien and G.R.R. Martin stand out, as well as the advice of guides such as Kobold, to give a solid character to the scenario in which the adventure takes place. The third comparison is between the stage of creating characters for a role-playing session, and the creation of the cast for a novel, analyzing topics such as past, skills, motivations, desires, strengths and weaknesses, which are some of the necessary elements for the creation of characters that are attractive to the audience. This extends even to role-playing video games, such as Final Fantasy (particularly VI). Finally, it will be exposed how these three tools of the role-playing game were used during the development of a series of fantasy novels published in 2019 and 2021. The objective of this paper is to present how role-playing games serve as tools for the development of literary narratives of fantasy and science fiction, from the structure of the story, to the creation of characters, through the construction of detailed worlds (better known as worldbuilding). This through comparisons with elements of the narrative mentioned above, such as narrative arc structure and the personal experience of one of the authors during the development of two fantasy novels published in the past three years.","2022-11-14","2022-11-22 16:51:58","2023-11-28 17:47:34","","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","es","","","","","","","","","","","_plot structure; _literature; _worldbuilding; _dnd; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _mexico; _wod","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Esta última entendida como la estructura que permite organizar sentimientos, emociones, percepciones e ideas de los sujetos sociales, en este caso, los jugadores/narradores. Es decir, hay una estructura organizativa interior que se genera en la interacción por medio del relato durante el juego. De esta forma, el relato/juego, se vuelve un mecanismo de construcción de subjetividades que es interiorizada por los participantes al mismo tiempo que se relata la historia. Volviendo así a los participantes narradores y consumidores de su propia estructura (inter) subjetiva. La estructura se vuelve un acontecimiento que nace de la interacción entre narradores/jugadores, desde sus propias sensibilidades y que son compartidas durante el juego. No es que los jugadores terminen con la misma (inter)subjetividad, pero al menos hay rasgos característicos que comparten entre jugadores/narradores: desde valores similares, formas de jugar, entendimiento del juego, objetivos, sensaciones, percepciones e ideas. Las subjetividades se alimentan entre sí después de varias sesiones de juego. La anterior dinámica favorece a la expansión de lo que aquí se propone llamar como horizontes de interpretación de los jugadores/narradores. Es decir, los parámetros de creación de símbolos, significados y discursos, que se gestan durante la sesión de juego, dándole especificidad a cada mesa. En este sentido, cada grupo de narradores/jugadores se vuelve un acontecimiento único permitiendo espacios de emancipación de la subjetividad neoliberal, producida por la sociedad del capitalismo tardío. La ponencia se articula sobre las nociones teóricas de Gilles Deleuze, particularmente en el texto de Empirismo y subjetividad, en el cual Deleuze hace una radiografía de la filosofía de David Hume, y pone el acento en la imaginación como producción de conocimiento, estableciendo que el empirismo es el nacimiento de la subjetividad. Lo anterior será complementado con las nociones de micropolítica de Félix Guattari, Michel Foucault y Suely Rolnick como manifestaciones de las organizaciones del poder en los niveles más personales de los sujetos sociales, llegando inclusive a las mesas de juegos de rol. Ahí, la narración/juego se dirime como espacio de emancipación de la subjetividad neoliberal, aquí definida como una producción maquínica e industrial de regímenes de organizaciones internas de emociones, percepciones y sensaciones. Todo esto visto como un proceso de resignificaciones entre discursos y símbolos. Así, los juegos de rol serían espacios de resignificación y emancipación de la subjetividad neoliberal, en los cuales los narradores/jugadores pueden crear su propia (inter)subjetividad colectivamente. ENGLISH This proposal seeks to establish that, through the narration and construction of a collective story, which takes place in a role-playing game; a shared (inter)subjectivity is created among the members of the role-playing games. The latter understood as the structure that allows to organize feelings, emotions, perceptions and ideas of the social subjects, in this case, the players / narrators. That is, there is an internal organizational structure that is generated in the interaction through the story during the game. In this way, the story/game becomes a mechanism of construction of subjectivities that is internalized by the participants at the same time that the story is told. Thus returning to the participants narrators and consumers of their own (inter) subjective structure. The structure becomes an event that is born from the interaction between narrators / players, from their own sensibilities and that are shared during the game. It's not that players end up with the same (inter)subjectivity, but at least there are characteristic traits they share between players/storytellers: from similar values, ways of playing, understanding of the game, goals, sensations, perceptions and ideas. Subjectivities feed off each other after several game sessions. The above dynamic favors the expansion of what is proposed here to be called as horizons of interpretation of the players/narrators. That is, the parameters of creation of symbols, meanings and speeches, which are developed during the game session, giving specificity to each table. In this sense, each group of narrators/players becomes a unique event allowing spaces of emancipation from neoliberal subjectivity, produced by the society of late capitalism. The paper is articulated on the theoretical notions of Gilles Deleuze, particularly in the text of Empiricism and subjectivity, in which Deleuze makes an x-ray of the philosophy of David Hume, and emphasizes the imagination as a production of knowledge, establishing that empiricism is the birth of subjectivity. This will be complemented by the notions of micropolitics of Félix Guattari, Michel Foucault and Suely Rolnick as manifestations of the organizations of power at the most personal levels of social subjects, even reaching the tables of role-playing games. There, the narrative/game is directed as a space of emancipation from neoliberal subjectivity, here defined as a machinic and industrial production of regimes of internal organizations of emotions, perceptions and sensations. All this seen as a process of resignifications between discourses and symbols. Thus, role-playing games would be spaces of resignification and emancipation from neoliberal subjectivity, in which narrators/players can create their own (inter)subjectivity collectively.","2022-11-14","2022-11-22 16:51:58","2023-11-16 16:52:35","","","","1","1","","","Narración colectiva, horizontes de interpretación y subjetividad","","","","","","","es","","","","","","","","","","","_philosophy; _group dynamics; _teamwork; _collaborative; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Por ese motivo, la presente investigación argumenta que los juegos de rol pueden influir en la construcción de las relaciones interpersonales en niños. Mediante el análisis teórico, se ha buscado en el capítulo 1analizar desarrollo de los juegos de rol; explicando -mediante un marco conceptual debidamente articulado- las motivaciones detrás del juego, para, luego, poder discutir la importancia y necesidad de los juegos. Este estudio concluye que los juegos de rol pueden brindar beneficios en la representación y expresión de los niños, entre otros factores. Cabe resaltar, la importancia que tiene en el desarrollo cognitivo del niño (tanto a nivel de procesos cognitivos básicos como complejos). Un dato adicional que debe ser tomado en cuenta, es que se ha podido identificar que los aportes que brindan los juegos de rol van a depender del nivel de cercanía de la relación entre un jugador y el otro. Finalmente, también se resalta la necesidad del acompañamiento y las contribuciones de adultos y pares en torno a los niños y sus ambientes de socialización (e.g. el contexto lúdico), pues cada espacio de interacción social aporta de alguna manera al desarrollo del niño, ya sea presentando nuevos caminos para resolver problemas, posibilidad de comparación de habilidades para medir competencia, entre otros. En ese sentido, es beneficioso que los padres entiendan las ventajas sociales, cognitivas y afectivas que traen los juegos, y participen en estos con sus hijos. ENGLISH Role-playing games have existed for more than 50 years; however, their impact and benefits in children's development are not valued and/or recognized. For this reason, this research argues that role-playing games can influence the construction of interpersonal relationships in children. By means of theoretical analysis, chapter 1 seeks to analyze the development of role-playing games, explaining -through a properly articulated conceptual framework- the motivations behind the game, in order to then discuss the importance and necessity of the games. This study concludes that role-playing games can provide benefits in the representation and expression of children, among other factors. It is worth highlighting its importance in children's cognitive development (both at the level of basic and complex cognitive processes). An additional fact that should be taken into account is that it has been identified that the contributions provided by role-playing games will depend on the level of closeness of the relationship between one player and the other. Finally, the need for accompaniment and the contributions of adults and peers around children and their socialization environments (e.g. the play context) is also highlighted, since each social interaction space contributes in some way to the child's development, either by presenting new ways to solve problems, the possibility of comparing skills to measure competence, among others. In this sense, it is beneficial that parents understand the social, cognitive and affective advantages that games bring, and participate in them with their children.","2022-11-14","2022-11-22 16:51:58","2023-11-16 16:52:34","","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","es","","","","","","","","","","","_empathy; _teamwork; _yo13-19; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _soft skills; _yo1-12; _LEARNING; _EMOTIONS; _SOCIOLOGY; _mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Generalmente, se adaptaron sus idiosincrasias al contexto didáctico-pedagógico, como simulación de situaciones relevantes para el tema a enseñar. Pocas veces fue aprovechado su potencial para servir de puente entre la historiografía (escritura de la historia), la narratología (estudio de las narraciones), la metahistoria (estudio de cómo se escribe e interpreta la historiografía en tanto narración). En esta ponencia proponemos estudiar cómo las herramientas de un juego de rol particular colaboran con el estudio metahistórico de la conquista del imperio azteca, teniendo en cuenta la polisemia de la expresión: el sometimiento que la triple alianza realizó sobre otros pobladores aborígenes, y el que sufrió a manos de los conquistadores españoles. A su vez, pusimos esa propuesta en práctica y compartimos los resultados del experimento. En particular, diseñamos el juego de rol Leyenda (en prensa) con procedimientos precisos para construir cuatro tipos de módulos. Estos son: Ambición (para crear un módulo en el que una comunidad está sufriendo cambios indeseados), Intriga (para crear uno en el que una comunidad está sufriendo por las luchas internas de sus facciones), Misión (para crear uno en el que una comunidad está sufriendo daños y alguien debe buscar cómo repararlos), y Rebelión (para crear uno en el que la comunidad está sufriendo por la lucha entre el orden establecido y los disidentes). Al ser jugados, despliegan una narración única al grupo, que, ya terminada, encaja con uno de los cuatro tipos de relatos identificados por Northrop Frye (Anatomy of Criticism, 1957): Comedia, Épica, Ironía y Tragedia. Proponemos que, para adaptar una situación histórica a un módulo de juego, es necesario hacer una investigación, seleccionar y explicitar las fuentes investigadas (sean literarias, fílmicas, históricas, etc.), a partir de las cuales se destilarán los elementos necesarios para escribir el módulo. Al seguir los procedimientos del juego, especialmente diseñados teniendo en cuenta modelos narratológicos, el grupo desplegará su creatividad, construyendo su propia leyenda sobre esos elementos básicos que fueron destilados de las fuentes. A partir del análisis narratológico de esa leyenda resultante, es posible compararlo con las posturas sobre cómo investigar una situación histórica, cómo seleccionar las fuentes más apropiadas, y cómo, cuando se expone una interpretación, su narración suele ajustarse a alguno de los cuatro tipos de relatos de Frye, algo ya señalado por Hayden White (Metahistory, 1973). Para poner a prueba esa hipótesis, llevamos a cabo un experimento: investigamos la situación histórica de la conquista del imperio azteca, seleccionando y explicitando nuestras fuentes (primarias, secundarias, ficcionales y lúdicas); luego, creamos un módulo por cada uno de los cuatro procedimientos en función de la investigación; después, los dimos a directores de juego para que los jueguen, junto con cuestionarios para recopilar información sobre sus partidas; y finalmente, hicimos un análisis del resultado desde el cruce de esas áreas con nuestra propuesta lúdica, que servirán para fomentar relecturas de esa situación histórica crítica. ENGLISH Role-playing games were already thought of as an educational tool. Generally, their idiosyncrasies were adapted to the didactic-pedagogical context, as a simulation of situations relevant to the subject to be taught. Their potential to serve as a bridge between historiography (the writing of history), narratology (the study of narratives), and metahistory (the study of how historiography is written and interpreted as a narrative) was rarely exploited. In this paper we propose to study how the tools of a particular role-playing game collaborate with the metahistorical study of the conquest of the Aztec empire, taking into account the polysemy of the expression: the subjugation that the triple alliance carried out on other aboriginal settlers, and the one suffered at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors. In turn, we put this proposal into practice and shared the results of the experiment. In particular, we designed the Leyenda role-playing game (in press) with precise procedures for constructing four types of modules. These are: Ambition (to create a module in which a community is undergoing unwanted changes), Intrigue (to create one in which a community is suffering from factional infighting), Mission (to create one in which a community is suffering damage and someone must seek to repair it), and Rebellion (to create one in which the community is suffering from the struggle between the established order and dissidents). When played, they unfold a unique narrative to the group, which, when completed, fits one of the four types of stories identified by Northrop Frye (Anatomy of Criticism, 1957): Comedy, Epic, Irony, and Tragedy. We propose that, in order to adapt a historical situation to a game module, it is necessary to do research, select and make explicit the sources investigated (be they literary, filmic, historical, etc.), from which the elements necessary to write the module will be distilled. By following the procedures of the game, specially designed taking into account narratological models, the group will deploy its creativity, building its own legend on those basic elements that were distilled from the sources. From the narratological analysis of that resulting legend, it is possible to compare it with the positions on how to investigate a historical situation, how to select the most appropriate sources, and how, when an interpretation is exposed, its narration usually conforms to one of Frye's four types of narratives, something already pointed out by Hayden White (Metahistory, 1973). To test this hypothesis, we conducted an experiment: we investigated the historical situation of the conquest of the Aztec empire, selecting and making explicit our sources (primary, secondary, fictional and ludic); then, we created a module for each of the four procedures according to the investigation; then, we gave them to game directors to play, together with questionnaires to collect information about their games; and finally, we made an analysis of the result from the crossing of those areas with our ludic proposal, which will serve to encourage rereadings of that critical historical situation.","2022-11-15","2022-11-22 16:51:58","2023-11-16 16:52:36","","","","1","1","","","Imaginar la historia","","","","","","","es","","","","","","","","","","","_history; _minority; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _mexico","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Perceived Learning Areas After Participating in an Edularp","","","","","https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/59234","Purpose: To find out if there is a difference in what is perceived about learning depending on your relation to edularp. Theory: Hammer at al’s (2018) model of educational features of role-playing. The model consists of five main features that each has a number of sub parts. The five main features are Portraying a character, Manipulation a fictional world, Altered sense of reality, Shared imagination, and Making RPGs. The feature Making RPGs is not used since it is not relevant for this study. Method: Using a pre-existing quantitive survey and making qualitative interviews with edularp participants. The four interviewees have different relations to edularp. Two are student participants, one is a teacher and one is a designer. The data are analysed with Hammer at al’s (2018) model to see what features each participant see and if they see anything that is not covered by the model. Result: In the end there does not seem to be any clear differences in perceptions about learning from edularps regardless if you are a student, a teacher or a designer. What seems to affect most is more connected to how immersed you are in the larp rather than what relationship you have to it. There do seem to be a difference between what parts that were easy or hard to perceive. When applying Hammer et al's (2018) key features about learning through RPGs and edularps to the experience of participants we can see that some learning features in edularps are easier perceived than others. Two areas were found that after further research might be relevant to ad to Hammer at al’s (2018) model, Agency and Personal growth.","2019-02-16","2022-11-29 15:03:28","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-11-29 11:15:14","","32","","","","","Who Sees What?","","","","","Gothenburg University","Gothenburg","en","","BA Education","","","gupea.ub.gu.se","","Accepted: 2019-02-16T12:21:17Z","","","","_debriefing; _motivation; _yo13-19; _teaching; _nordic larp; _benefits of rpg; =cleaned; =MF; _LARP; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They can be depicted in a plethora of different ways, and be used as narrative or world building tools in game texts. Magic in games can be discussed and analysed as a game mechanic that influences the gameplay—for example when the player’s avatar is brought back to life because resurrection magic exists in the game world—or as the main plot point around which the entire story of a game is based on—such as in the case where the player has to fulfil various tasks in the game to lift an evil curse. This paper will focus primarily on magic as an element that facilitates the creation and development of different identities in a variety of games, as well as on the different ways of depicting, defining and classifying magic and the manner in which they influence potential individual and group identities in specific games. Based on examples of tabletop role-playing games and digital games, the paper will explore and analyse the way in which games depict and define diverse types of magic influencing and shaping the identities of singular entities, as well as larger groups, communities, classes, and even entire races of beings.","2022","2022-12-08 01:43:03","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Edition Donau-Universität Krems","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_identity; _worldbuilding; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","Koenig, Nikolaus; Denk, Natalie; Pfeiffer, Alexander; Wernbacher, Thomas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As I developed the project and the world behind it, I gained a clearer understanding of the universe I want to portray and create with my future work.

In classic RPGs such as ""Dungeons and Dragons"" players often use boards, mockups, models, dioramas and miniatures for tactical orientation in situations where it is essential from the mechanics point of view (e.g. during combat sequences). Virtual game tables allowed for this types of props to be digitized including automation of some mechanical activities related to the game (statistics of objects, markers for area effects, fields of view, fogs of war etc.). This turned out to be so attractive that some players began to mix the classic pen and paper RPG’s gameplay (requiring the physical presence of players at the table and face to face communication), with virtual tools which then allow for projection onto table’s surface, walls or to the TVs, tablets and smartphones.

They usually have a middle class background, and are between 16-40 years of age. From time to time, groups of players organise unique plays that they take part in. These plays last from a couple of hours up to a week. They take place in a geographical location that is selected in advance by organisers. The plays are about simulating a make-believe setting, which has its own characters, conflicts and dramatic events, culture, and background history. People who are acting together, or communicating with each other, always do this in the context of a specific definition of a situation. My research question is to look at how the laiv players make and maintain their play situation. A definition of a situation implies a variety of structures that influence the interaction of the participants.  The participants of the situation act in accordance to a set of roles, as well as a normative background that regulates what one should and should not do. These structures also include the background information that one uses when interpreting the meaning of the actions of others. In other words, the study of the process by which a situation is defined is a study of the process by which the social reality becomesstructured. Researchers that study this topic have focused on the relation between general structures – in the form of shared conventions and knowledge, habits and so on – and particular actions that are done in unique contexts of interaction. This study takes an ethnographic approach to this question, with analysis of interviews, observations, and internet texts being the primary method. To play, each of the players is assigned a character in advance. The players emphasise a ‘realistic’ resemblance of physical traits, in order to play the character. Maybe this makes it easier to communicate a character. Nevertheless, players are usually capable of ignoring a lack of resemblance in relation to such traits as height and physical build. Then they increase their ability to structure play in the way they want. External influence from the surrounding culture makes it difficult to ignore lack of resemblance to some traits such as gender and ethnicity.   Some players may lose their involvement in play, or one may risk that players become too involved and fail to separate play from ‘real life’, or actions in play may develop in such a way that play cannot continue. The play situation can then break down for these and other players. The players have a repertoire of techniques to handle this. The play may be stopped, the problematic events sorted out, and then the play can be restarted. Another way is by accepting the performance of one’s co-players, without scrutinising or denying any inconsistencies. This also greatly decreases their need for communicating details. On the one hand, the players and organisers use a variety of preparations and rehearsals in advance of play in order to shape their actions in play. On the other hand, this rarely determines actions completely, leaving considerable room for improvisatory action during play. When improvising, the performance becomes more stereotypic, and this is less ‘realistic’ in some players’ eyes. The players try to have a visual similarity between their material world and the material world in play, and they select and shape their objects and surroundings to achieve such similarity. They are limited by their resources when doing so, but they are capable of ignoring inconsistencies that are impractical to fix. Material objects and surroundings have communicative effects on play in terms of their being shared symbolic signs, and in terms of their physical effects. Players use both of these to communicate the situation of play itself, and to make distinctions in play clearer. To sum up, the process of making and maintaining a definition of a situation involves both using pre-existing structures - in the form of general conventions and particular knowledge of and habits in a situation that are learned and rehearsed in advance - and the use of techniques actively to shape and maintain the situation when acting during play. There is a close relationship between the pre-existing structures and action in context in the process of making and maintaining the play situation. This is particularly clear in five ways throughout the text. First, the players have a great capability of adapting the process of making and maintaining a situation to the demands and possibilities of the particular context of action. Second, the use of conventions that exist in advance of play are intertwined with the interaction in the context of performance. Third, at several places one sees clearly how action is both structured according to pre-existing structure, while simultaneously structuring future action. Fourth, the material environment are a given structure constantly intertwined in the context of performance. Fifth, looking at how the definition of the situation can break down, provides information about the relation between the general conventions of play and the demands of the context of performance.

A classic study published by G. A. Fine, inspired by the work of E. Goffman and his  frame analysis (see Fine 2002), describes three of these “worlds of meaning”: the frame of the people, the frame of the players and the frame of the characters in the game. This work aims to  broaden classical analytical model presented by G. A. Fine by adding fourth frame of meaning  “the frame of the storytellers”. Adding the frame of the storytellers shows, to which extend role­ playing games resemble “storytelling events” (Georges 1969), and how this fact differentiates  this genre from “classical” games.  This  framework  broadens  the  understating  of  players  behavior tied with the storyteller’s agenda and expectations linked to this role. This unique form  of collaborative narration is consequently studied from the perspective of the game as well as  from the perspective of storytelling, while focusing on the moments of discrepancies occurring between the four frames, but also on the prevention and management of such discrepancies, and  application  of  skills  and  competencies  acquired  and  cultivated  during  the  game  in  the  non­ gaming world in the primary framework of the “real” world.","2022","2022-12-14 15:39:56","2024-02-09 15:51:34","","","114","","","","","Kde se potkávají hry a příběhy: Čtyři rámce významu v herním systému City of Mist","","","","","Charles University of Prague","Praha","en","","Master thesis in Sociology","","","","","","","","","_collaborative; _metagame; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on the modern Māori way of life and identity, as well as analysis of the current political landscape Māori live within in Aotearoa and the world will be a primary focus of this thesis and creative output. The many ways Māori identify in Aotearoa are and will continue to change. The ability to navigate those changes to seek and find belonging through the playing of TTRPGs is the main aim of this thesis. There are many types of TTRPGs, the emergent narratives of imaginative and collaborative storytelling create meaningful moments for players to live out scenarios they may not be able to in real life. The creative output of this thesis is a game that aims to create moments for Māori who identify on across the spectrum of connection to their culture to play out moments in their fictional character’s life, giving them agency in a fictional world where in the real world they may have none. The imagined moments shared in these stories live on in the minds of their players and affect them in meaningful ways throughout their lives. Qualitative research was gathered that highlighted the many identities of Māori across a spectrum of connection. Interviews and playthroughs conducted following the Kaupapa Kōrero conversation methodology guide the research. This thesis emulates through gameplay the conversations Māori have in their journey to reconnect to their culture. This thesis concludes that TTRPGs are an invaluable tool to help navigate the conversations one has when reconnecting with one’s culture.","2022-12-13","2022-12-14 19:57:23","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2022-12-14 19:51:26","","84","","","","","Broken Narratives","","","","","Te Herenga Waka-Victoria University of Wellington","Wellington","en","","Master of Design","","","openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz","","DOI: 10.26686/wgtn.21714551","","","","_anthropology; _collaborative; _minority; _translation; _TTRPG; _transformative; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Montfort then discusses Adventure and its precursors (including the I Ching and Dungeons and Dragons), and follows this with an examination of mainframe text games developed in response, focusing on the most influential work of that era, Zork. He then considers the introduction of commercial interactive fiction for home computers, particularly that produced by Infocom. Commercial works inspired an independent reaction, and Montfort describes the emergence of independent creators and the development of an online interactive fiction community in the 1990s. Finally, he considers the influence of interactive fiction on other literary and gaming forms.

Need for cognition, current motivation, immersion, flow, and learning outcome were measured by self-report questionnaires.ResultsA hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the impact of the predictor variables (need for cognition, current motivation, immersion, and flow) on the self-evaluated learning outcome. For the 2-hour group, the predictor variables interest, challenge, and immersion (subscale: engagement) impacted self-reported learning outcome significantly positive. For the 2-day group, significant predictors were need for cognition, interest, and immersion (subscale: engrossment). In comparison of the two game versions, students playing the 2-day version reported significantly higher levels of engagement, engrossment, and learning outcome.ConclusionThe cognitive-motivational process model of learning was partly supported: interest and immersion predict learning outcome in the live-action simulation game. The extended 2-day version of the game leads to higher levels of immersion and higher learning outcome, indicating that a longer timeframe secures the desired effects on learning outcome from simulation games. Further research needs to shed light on the interaction of personality traits and immersion.","2021-12-01","2022-12-20 16:24:34","2023-09-18 14:15:38","2022-12-20 16:24:34","775-795","","6","52","","","The Learning Process in Live-Action Simulation Games","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","_simulation; _motivation; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; =MF; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They often invoke heavy themes into their game play: morality, violence, politics, spirituality, or sexuality. Although interesting moral debates perennially appear in the media and academia concerning the appropriateness of games’ ability to deal with such adult concepts, very little is known about the intersection between games, playfulness, and sexuality and what this might mean for players. This book offers an in-depth, ethnographic look into the phenomenon of erotic role-play through the experiences of players in multiplayer and tabletop role-playing games. Brown explores why participants engage in erotic role-play; discusses the rules involved in erotic role-play; and uncovers what playing with sexuality in ludic environments means for players, their partners, and their everyday lives. Taken together, this book provides a rich, nuanced, and detailed account of a provocative topic.","2015-03-05","2022-12-21 15:19:46","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","157","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: PRTwBgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=PRTwBgAAQBAJ","_TTRPG; _sex-transgressive; =cleaned; =MF; _LARP; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, we choose Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) -- a role-playing game consisting of multiple player characters and a Dungeon Master (DM) who collaborate to achieve a set of goals that are beneficial to the players -- as a testbed for this task. Here, each of the player characters is a student, with their own personas and abilities, and the DM is the teacher, an arbitrator of the rules of the world and responsible for assisting and guiding the students towards a global goal. We propose a theory-of-mind-inspired methodology for training such a DM with reinforcement learning (RL), where a DM: (1) learns to predict how the players will react to its utterances using a dataset of D&D dialogue transcripts; and (2) uses this prediction as a reward function providing feedback on how effective these utterances are at guiding the players towards a goal. Human and automated evaluations show that a DM trained with RL to generate guidance by incorporating a theory-of-mind of the players significantly improves the players' ability to achieve goals grounded in their shared world.","2022-12-20","2022-12-22 21:55:47","2023-08-23 14:38:38","2022-12-22 21:54:06","","","","","","","An AI Dungeon Master's Guide","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2212.10060 [cs]","","","","_virtual table; _dnd; _pbem; _conversation; _data; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _stem; _ux; _ai ml llm; _text mining/text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2212.10060","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fiasco! is a part of a growing genre of collaborative roleplaying games (RPGs) that have important applications in the university classroom. Fiasco! is an innovative game system that upends the traditional model of Game Master-led RPGs to create a collaborative environment for players to create their own stories. This paper explores how the unique model embedded within Fiasco! can be employed as a pedagogical tool for active student-led learning.  To showcase the pedagogical innovations of a game like Fiasco!, we present classroom applications in English, Anthropology, and Sociology. Our experiences teaching with Fiasco! show how quickly and intuitively the game can be integrated into curricula with significant benefits for student engagement and learning. Roleplaying games that emphasize player agency, like Fiasco!, offer adaptive and innovative strategies for student-led learning in an interdisciplinary setting. Much as the structure of Fiasco! drives player engagement by making each player an equal participant in the generation of narrative content, using Fiasco! in the classroom allows each student an equal stake in developing course material. Beyond individual case studies, this article offers pedagogical inspiration for using Fiasco! in a variety of classroom settings that offer the possibility of an adaptive and interdisciplinary approach to student engagement.","2022","2023-01-05 15:04:27","2024-03-03 02:53:48","2023-01-05 14:50:47","","","4","9","","","Embracing the Fiasco!","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_motivation; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With a growing number of TRPG therapists nationwide using this modality in their clinical practices, this study aimed to develop a clearer understanding of the ways in which their therapeutic orientation, gaming practices, and knowledge of Autism Spectrum Conditions informs their use of TRPG psychotherapy with Autistic clients. Research that focuses on clinical decision-making and the knowledge that informs clinical interventions and technique generally refers to these as “clinical reasoning”. By observing therapy and interviewing therapists about their clinical practice, this study collected data about the different types of clinical reasoning TRPG therapists use when working with Autistic clients. Through the use of video-cued multivocal clinical ethnography, one TRPG therapist was observed and interviewed as she conducted TRPG therapy with Autistic clients and described the clinical reasoning behind the design and implementation of this treatment modality. Using ethnographic semi-structured interviewing and Brief Structured Recall (BSR), the video footage of the TRPG therapy served as a video cue for interviews with three other TRPG therapists, allowing the therapists to authentically reflect on the theoretical underpinnings behind their clinical judgement and decisions. As Autism psychotherapies have been expanding to include approaches integrative of behavioral as well as psychodynamic orientations, TRPG therapy as a “semi-directive” treatment offers an emergent treatment option that integrates directive and non-directive approaches to Autism treatment. TRPG therapists discussed the ongoing tension between non-directive and directive approaches to treatment, which simultaneously mirrored historical debates between these two approaches in play psychotherapy for Autistic patients. The results of this study reveal how TRPG therapists’ perspectives diverge from mainstream and previously held clinical views on Autism diagnosis and treatment. The results of this study show the alternative ways in which TRPG therapists view Autism symptomatology (i.e. sensorimotor needs, Theory of Mind, sociality) and the evolving nature of Autistic comportment that emerges through and is mediated by player immersion in the gaming space and interactions with the game’s structure and mechanics. Operating both as Dungeon Master and Therapist, the TRPG therapists discussed how they simultaneously utilized and integrated these multiple roles with competing paradigmatic perspectives while grappling with gaming, clinical, and cultural perspectives of Autism diagnosis and Autism treatment.","2022","2023-01-10 16:47:26","2023-02-18 00:44:02","","","477","","","","","","","","","","Duquesne University","","en","","PhD Psychology","","","Zotero","","","","","","_therapy; _autism; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This thesis probes D&D's PACS relevance through cultural, educational, play, and identity lenses and explores how D&D can deploy theoretical PACS principles as active, positive peace training. The significance of this study is twofold.

Descriptions of autistic play have typically focused on ‘deficits’ and are based on comparisons to neurotypical ‘norms’. According to the neurodiversity paradigm, it is important that autistic voices are highlighted, and that difficulties, differences and strengths are explored. With this in mind, we designed the present study to focus on the experiences and perspectives of autistic people concerning the topic of autistic play.MethodsWe conducted a consultation with autistic stakeholders, as well as with parents and teachers of autistic individuals to help us design the study and interview questions. We used semi-structured interviews with 22 autistic adults aged 18-57 (clinically confirmed diagnosis, n = 21; self-diagnosed, n = 1) who live in the UK. We analysed the data using interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify themes. Results We found important commonalities and differences in the ways that socialisation in play, imaginary play and flow (a state involving intense focus on the play) are experienced. Autistic adults discussed the importance of both solitary and social play, with solitary play having an important recuperative function. They also reported preferences for parallel play and playing with similar autistic people. They also discussed imaginary play experiences including social role play and grounded-in-reality play, and the dual nature of flow experiences during play.ConclusionsThe findings of this study contrast with deficit-focused understandings of autistic play and build on neurodiversity-informed studies. We highlight, for example, the importance of considering the different circumstances under which solitary or social play are preferred, as well as the importance of taking an individual approach to play. We encourage wider understanding and acceptance of these play preferences and experiences, to support autistic people’s wellbeing.","2023-01-12","2023-01-17 14:13:57","2023-02-18 00:44:02","2023-01-17 14:13:42","","","","","","","Social play as a “double-edged sword”","","","","","PsyArXiv","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","_therapy; _autism; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Left unexamined and uncontextualized in this discussion is the legal copyright status of Lovecraft’s original texts, which is significant since the ability to create derivative works is directly contingent upon their public domain status. This chapter surveys leading experts on the subject, such as S.T. Joshi, Chris Karr, Alex Houston and George Wetzel, in order to offer a determination of Lovecraft’s related copyrights based on their research, while also detailing how the decline of Arkham House’s legal authority on the matter as a self-espoused holder of exclusive rights provided an opportunity to those small creators without resources to generate their own works. The lack of a strong monopoly holder of Lovecraft’s copyrights directly contributed to an organic growth of Lovecraft derivative works that was not contingent on the approval, funding or encouragement of a central organization, and thus the cultural activities surrounding the works were characterized by the artists’ direct relationship to the texts, rather than the interference and agency of a central rights holder.","2023","2023-02-14 16:53:41","2023-02-18 00:42:54","2023-02-14 16:53:41","27-44","","","","","","Disseminating Lovecraft","Palgrave Studies in Adaptation and Visual Culture","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-13765-5_2","","","","_lovecraft; _copyright; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","","Lanzendörfer, Tim; Dreysse Passos de Carvalho, Max José","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By examining research on gaming, flow, immersion, and role-play, readers will gain a better understanding of the theoretical underpinnings and how to skillfully and ethically use RPGs in their own practices. The author also looks at the history of RPGs, specifically focusing on issues of diversity and representation to help providers understand some possible pitfalls that exist within the medium.

In the context of the global Covid-19 pandemic where the student experience was characterised by isolation, collaborative worldbuilding also offered a powerful means of building solidarity and community. This paper presents a case study of using collaborative worldbuilding for gaming to achieve key digital writing learning outcomes. The case study shows how this innovative pedagogical approach can be mapped to two key frameworks for information and digital literacies: the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens and the Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education of the Association of College and Research Libraries. The case study also illustrates how a MediaWiki installation can be used for worldbuilding and as a means of critically introducing students to Wikipedia itself. Qualitative feedback from the students shows that the class achieved its key learning outcomes. More importantly, student engagement during the class and their feedback ascertains that collaborative worldbuilding is a powerful means of building connections and empathy between students in the context of isolation, amid a global pandemic. Practitioner Notes     The worldbuilding framework for collaborative writing developed by Trent Hergenrader can be adapted to contribute to the goals of a first-year seminar. However, there are logistical and technical factors to consider.     Worldbuilding for gaming is an engaging class activity whether used for online or in-person education.     Using a MediaWiki installation as the platform for digital writing is a felicitous means of imparting proficiencies identified by two information literacy frames, the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education and the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens.     Worldbuilding by authoring encyclopaedic entries on a MediaWiki installation allows for a critical consideration of Wikipedia itself.     Genre knowledge is essential to a student’s development as a writer. Discussions of knowledge transfer often focus on the ability of students to apply and transfer expertise across disciplines. Speculative fiction writing based on academic research is an example of knowledge transfer between genres.","2023-02-22","2023-02-27 19:28:06","2023-09-18 14:15:38","","1-19","","2","20","","","Dungeons and dragons and digital writing","Special issue","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_information literacy; _worldbuilding; _writing; _dnd; _collaborative; _curriculum; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Theoretical comparison combined with script data from a student project and exemplification through three adventures.

Designers and researchers have tried to identify how aspects of TTRPGs facilitate collaboration, immersion, creativity, and more. However, there has been no attempt to develop a formal assessment methodology for player experience during TTRPG play. This paper argues that evaluating TTRPG players’ experience can provide vital data for Game Masters to improve on their future games, for players to reflect on their experience, and for TTRPG designers or event organizers to collect and compare data. As a first step towards developing such an evaluation method, we identify important dimensions of TTRPG play that can be meaningful to track and actionable to improve upon. Moreover, we review player experience dimensions and evaluation methods in digital games, and explore similarities and differences with TTRPGs.","2023-04-12","2023-03-07 14:30:31","2023-11-30 18:15:25","","1-10","","","","","","","","","","","ACM","Lisbon","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_assessment; _TTRPG; =cleaned; =scholarlyTTRPG; _ux; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Six participants were recruited from social media groups. All participants were over age 18years and had 3 or fewer years of experience playing the traditional role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons. Game play was conducted, managed, and observed through a virtual tabletop simulator during the 2020–2021 COVID-19 pandemic. Methods triangulation including semistructured interviews, journal prompts and entries, and observations were used to gather data from the study participants and game manager. Narrative data were coded and analyzed weekly to monitor for saturation and other quality controls. The data provided information from the perspectives of the game players leading and cooperating as a team. Data analysis resulted in three main themes (skill identification, social interactions, and leadership skills) and nine subthemes (weakness identification, problem identification, problem resolution, teamwork, delegation, conflict resolution, decision-making, emotional response, and empathy) demonstrating new learning capacities that were transferred socially to various life interactions. Results indicated that the participants gained the ability to recognize learned skills and how to transfer the new knowledge and skills from the campaign to their personal, social, and work lives. Study results increased the body of contextual knowledge on how professionals may view learning from gamification and role play opportunities and their recognition and perception of how to obtain new and transferable skills.","2023","2023-03-07 14:33:17","2024-02-09 15:47:18","2023-03-07 14:31:24","","127","","","","","","","","","","University of Arizona Global Campus","United States -- Arizona, US","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Organizational Developmen and Leardership","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798371919809","","","","_gamification; _dnd; _leadership; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","Adult learning; Skill transference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How did the posts of a (supposedly) anonymous government insider named Q on an obscure online imageboard in October 2017 instigate a serious conspiracy movement taking part in the storming of the US Capitol in early 2021? Returning to the origins of QAnon on 4chan?s Politically Incorrect board and its initial reception as a potential LARP, we analyze it as an instance of participatory online play that fosters deep engagement above all. Drawing on concepts from play and performance studies, we theorize the dynamics by which QAnon developed into an influential conspiracy narrative as instances of ?conspiracy fictioning.? In particular, we revive the notion of hyperstition to make sense of how such conspiracy fictionings work to recursively ?bootstrap? their own alternate realities into existence. By thus exploring the participatory and playful engagement mechanisms that drive today?s conspiracy movements, we aim to elucidate the epistemological and socio-political dynamics that mark the growing entanglement of play and politics, fact and fiction in society.","2023-01-01","2023-03-09 04:53:52","2023-09-18 14:15:38","2023-03-09 04:52:58","","","1","9","","","A God-Tier LARP?","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","_playfulness; _social media; _conspiracy theory; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UTHEINMH","thesis","2022","Bytyçi, Anina; Würth, Isaac; Zanetti, Marco","SecureRole","","","","","https://eprints.ost.ch/id/eprint/1063/","Over the last couple of years, cyber security attacks have become a dominant issue in the global landscape. Phishing campaigns are on the rise and the world is in a current ""gold rush for ransomware"". Companies are being targeted with an increased frequency all around the world. This calls for IT experts, which often receive their first in-depth training in security during their time at college or in secondary education. The goal of this thesis is to better prepare students with the development of an incident response role-playing game. This can be achieved by collaborative training and using simulations to mimic a situation as close as possible to the real-world scenario. Teaching with versatile and adaptable scenarios builds up skills to prepare a company against different kinds of attacks and how to mitigate them, should one of its systems be compromised. Additionally, they learn to appropriately react, how to communicate, and on which basis to make meaningful decisions, as a key to success for eradication of the attacker and recovery to normal operation.  The result of the bachelor thesis is a framework, that gives guidance for the creation of packages and scenarios in a versatile and adaptable way, packages, that can be chained to create scenarios, and predefined scenarios to directly start a cybersecurity role-playing game. The framework allows for interchangeable content, which makes it possible to change certain parts of the role-play giving it an agile nature. The packages also include additional materials, such as text scripts, presentations, and curated internet content to deepen the knowledge about cyber security attack techniques and mitigations. The predefined scenarios are created with the packages and were tested during the thesis.  It started with an analysis of existing products, we evaluated if any of them could be an exact fit for our purposes. Sadly, none of them fully met the requirements. So we then used them to draw inspiration for our product. After we defined how the game is going to be played and how the framework for content creation is structured, we started the process of content creation itself. For verification and improvements of the content, we established a process of peer-reviews, asked external educators for their opinions, and tested it with our target audience. The created content was finally verified with an acceptance test, the results of which allowed for final improvements to be made to the product.  The landscape of cybersecurity threats is ever-changing, and incident responders need to be trained with an adequately agile approach. Our product offers a solid framework that allows us to create, edit and change our scenarios to keep the simulation dynamic and tailor it to the user's needs. This allows us to provide an interactive learning experience that helps inexperienced students take their first steps in a simulated environment, or advanced students hone their skills.

Pourtant, ses caractéristiques en font une médiation particulièrement intéressante pour l’accompagnement des adolescents. Objectifs L’objectif de cet article sera de préciser les caractéristiques malléables spécifiques du jeu de rôle, et de définir comment elles relancent la symbolisation dans un contexte pathologique, mais également pour le processus de construction de l’identité. Méthode Nous nous appuierons sur les notions d’interactivité et d’intercréativité pour tenter de définir les caractéristiques du jeu de rôle, et leurs interactions avec certains des processus thérapeutiques fondamentaux. Nous puiserons dans une approche psychanalytique, mais également ludologique et narratologique pour tenter de définir les contours de cette médiation. Résultats L’interactivité et l’intercréativité influencent directement les processus d’immersion dans le jeu et la fiction, et d’identification au personnage incarné par le joueur. L’interaction entre ces différents ingrédients se révèle porteuse des processus de transformation de la subjectivité. Conclusion L’interactivité est un élément fondamental dans l’émergence de l’agentivité. Elle constitue donc un ingrédient particulièrement intéressant dans les thérapies d’adolescents. Par ailleurs, le recours à d’autres champs théoriques apparaît nécessaire pour penser un outil tel que le jeu de rôle. Context Tabletop role-playing games (TTRPG) have shown their relevance in play and narrative therapy. However, they have been little studied in the psychodynamic field although their characteristics make them a particularly interesting mediation in adolescents’ psychotherapy. Objectives The aim of this article is to specify the characteristics of role-playing games, and to define how they revive symbolization and the identity construction process. Method We will rely on the notions of interactivity and intercreativity to define the characteristics of TTRPG, and their interactions with some of the fundamental therapeutic processes. We will draw on a psychoanalytical approach as well as a ludological and narratological one to define this mediation. Results Interactivity and intercreativity directly influence the processes of immersion in game and fiction. They also influence identification with the character embodied by the player. The interaction between these different ingredients supports processes of psychic transformation. Conclusion Interactivity is a fundamental element in the emergence of agentivity. It is therefore a particularly interesting ingredient in adolescent therapy. Moreover, recourse to other theoretical fields appears necessary when envisioning a TTRPG psychotherapeutic mediation.","2023-05-01","2023-03-10 18:57:37","2024-03-03 02:40:26","2023-03-10 18:56:50","100333","","1","7","","In Analysis","Jeu de rôle et fiction interactive","Enveloppes psychiques, politiques et sociétales","","","","","","fr","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","_immersion; _storytelling; _therapy; _agency; _identity; _collaborative; _yo13-19; _psychoanalysis; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _transformative; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The game is played by a group of players, each of whom takes on the role of a character in a fantasy world. The players work together to complete quests, overcome obstacles, and defeat monsters while a ""Dungeon Master"" (DM) manages the story and controls the non-player characters (NPCs). In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in using D&amp;D and other tabletop RPGs as a form of mental health therapy. This is because the game can provide a safe and supportive environment for players to explore and express their emotions, work on personal issues, and build social skills. Tabletop RPGs can help foster personal growth in several ways: Problem-solving, Decision-Making, Emotional Intelligence, Communication, Creativity, Self-Esteem, and even Confidence.

Cet espace potentiel particulier conduit les joueurs à la création d’identités narratives, nourries par les échanges et les expériences partagés avec les pairs. Cette identité est l’objet de projections de fragments de soi et de son histoire personnelle qui vont être mis en scène par le biais de l’image, de l’acte et du langage. Méthode Quatre participants ont été recrutés grâce à une annonce déposée sur les serveurs d’échanges de différentes communautés du même jeu en ligne. Les hypothèses ont été évaluées à travers une série de deux entretiens semi-directifs en distanciel reposant sur une grille de dix thèmes. Résultats Les résultats montrent que le jeu de rôle est investi comme un outil de réécriture de l’histoire personnelle grâce auquel les participants peuvent réparer fantasmatiquement blessures et traumatismes individuels et familiaux. Nous observons également que la transparence digitale favorise la spontanéité des communications de par sa fonction désinhibitrice : le jeu de rôle dans les jeux en ligne se révèle être un réel espace potentiel de créativité où les participants peuvent interagir par essai-erreur sans crainte d’être mis en échec et exprimer leurs émotions et désirs sans détruire l’autre ou être détruits, car il s’agit de faire-semblant. Ainsi, ils développent leur subjectivité et tentent un meilleur accordage affectif avec la possibilité d’une meilleure intégration au sein de la communauté humaine virtuelle et matérielle. La transparence digitale, incite les participants à investir le jeu de rôle en tant que lieu de projection et de mise en scène de leurs contenus psychiques sous la forme d’une répétition symbolique où l’histoire familiale, voire le roman familial, sont réinterprétés et deviennent des facteurs de transformation, de réconciliation ou d’émancipation. Discussion Les identités narratives sont un véritable reflet des préoccupations des participants et sont investies pendant et en dehors des séances de jeu. À travers une position de narrateur, les participants échangent et tissent des liens de sens et d’amitié avec les autres joueurs. Ils cherchent à donner un sens à un vécu subjectif partagé qu’ils inscrivent dans leur patrimoine de soi ainsi que dans la mémoire collective du groupe. Ici, le jeu de rôle fournit une forme de contenance pour les éventuels affects dépressifs et détourne l’attention des angoisses, tel le divertissement pascalien. Cet espace pourrait d’abord servir de sorte de prothèse technologique substitutive de fonctions psychiques défaillantes pour certains joueurs qui peinent à exprimer leurs émotions et à tisser des liens. Mais au fil des années, ceux-ci paraissent plutôt se saisir de l’étayage fourni par cette orthèse psychique, de lien et de liaison, pour réécrire leur histoire, aller à la rencontre de l’Autre et d’eux-mêmes. Conclusion Dans ce lieu où les espaces potentiels se chevauchent, les joueurs tentent d’orienter leur propres vies en s’étayant sur les expériences qu’ils ont pu co-construire à travers une narrativité individuelle et commune, présentée comme à la fois étrangère et propre à soi. Ainsi, ils peuvent se sentir mieux armés pour affronter cette intersubjectivité parfois vécue comme décevante ou menaçante que peut être le theatrum mundi.","2023-03","2023-03-17 13:41:45","2023-09-18 14:15:38","2023-03-17 13:40:02","S0014385523000129","","0","0","","L'Évolution Psychiatrique","Jeu de rôle en ligne","","","","","","","fr","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","_storytelling; _mental disorder; _therapy; _escapism; _identity; _empathy; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the wealth of literature on the topic of play-based learning, it is not clear how play factors such as play materials (toys, objects, imaginative spaces), permissiveness (player autonomy), and structure (role-based play, interaction rules) contribute to skill development. This paper reviews the literature on play-based social interventions and will compare three play-based approaches based on materials, permissiveness, and structure: (a) LEGO-therapy, (b) virtual environment social program, and (c) therapeutically applied role-playing games.

A substantial body of literature has been produced regarding the application of TTRPGs within the context of therapy, as an activity promoting psychological development and improved mental health. This hermeneutic study examines TTRPGs through a depth psychological framework and explores a gap in the literature, inquiring specifically about what archetypal and imaginal psychology can reveal about their psychotherapeutic value. The analysis that follows deconstructs previous suggestions made in the literature that TTRPGs benefit individuals via interpretation and subsequent interventions. The findings of this study indicate that TTRPGs serve a therapeutic function by ritualizing participation with fantasy-images that instantiate mythological narratives, thereby facilitating reflective insight on and observation of underlying psychological processes. Recommendations are suggested for further investigation of the concepts explored in this study pertaining to specific populations that may benefit from nontraditional approaches to psychotherapy.","2023","2023-03-29 14:09:54","2023-11-28 18:00:06","2023-03-29 14:08:28","","73","","","","","Adventuring into the Imaginal","","","","","Pacifica Graduate Institute","Carpinteria","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.   in Counseling Psychology","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798377628071","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","Archetypal psychology; Depth psychology; Imaginal psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I argue that these games go beyond representing and mediating anxieties around ecological disaster. Instead, I propose that they offer a generative mode of collaborative worldbuilding in a time of climate crisis. I interrogate the ethics of TTRPGs through the lens of ecocriticism, identifying tensions between game texts and game play. These tensions exist between the expression of ecophobia—which tends to position nature as an antagonist—and the attribution of moral considerability and agency to the more-than-human world. Such tensions are productive and play out through collaborative storytelling techniques and ludic mechanics that invite players to reflect on the interrelationship between humans and the worlds in which they are embedded.","2023-02-16","2023-02-18 00:37:15","2023-03-29 14:23:22","2023-03-29 14:20:54","129-140","","","","","","Dark forests and doomed adventurers","","","","","ETC Press","Pittsburgh, PA","en","cc_by_nc_nd_4","","","","e-space.mmu.ac.uk","","Num Pages: 11","","","","_ecology; _horror; _fear; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _GAMEPLAY","","Torner, Evan; Jones, Shelly; Chang, Edmond; Condis, Megan; Trammell, Aaron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Generation Analog: the Tabletop Games and Education Conference 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part of this research involved using game design to teach topics from various disciplines, with students making, hacking, and modding games to achieve educational goals in STEM, literature, social studies, theatre, and emergent topics. During that time, I led two teams that worked through trial and error to develop a teaching methodology that I call Gamemaking in Education (GME). This educational approach emphasizes student gamemaking rather than gameplay. In this paper, I discuss what GME is, review some cases in which other educators have used what might be called GME in college classrooms, and situate GME as an application of other proven educational methods including the maker movement in education, project-based learning, and experiential learning. I also offer strategizes for those who wish to implement GME in their classrooms, along with some recommendations for those who wish to engage in future study of GME.","2023","2023-04-05 14:12:36","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","ETC Press","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _DESIGN; _designing rpg","","Torner, Evan; Jones, Shelly; Chang, Edmond; Trammell, Aaron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(D&D) is a table-top role playing game where players take on the personality and actions of a character in the fictional game designed by the Game Master, or GM.

In role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), composing prompts using generative AI requires a technical understanding to generate ideal results, which is difficult for novices. Thus, emergent narratives organically developed based on player actions and decisions have yet to be fully utilized. This paper envisions the use of generative AI in transforming storytelling into an interactive drama using dynamic and immersive narratives. First, we describe scenarios where narratives are created and character conversations are designed within an overarching fantasy disposition. Then, we recommend design guidelines to help create tools using generative AI in interactive storytelling. Lastly, we raise questions on its potential impact on player immersion and cognitive load. Our contributions may be expanded within the broader interactive storytelling domain, such as speech-conversational AI and persona-driven chatbots.","2023-04-04","2023-04-11 15:13:36","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-04-11 15:13:18","","","","","","","Rolling the Dice","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2304.01860 [cs]","","","","_dnd; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _ai ml llm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2304.01860","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (Multiple authors, 2014) actual plays, audiences can engage with racialized narratives in underappreciated ways. The actual play Critical Role (Critical Role, 2012-present) employs players’ knowledge of the genre of high fantasy to create collaborative, improvisational narratives which delve into themes of racism and bigotry. This dynamic often leads players to draw on real world political narratives and discourses in order to engage audiences’ prior knowledge and examine pertinent themes. This paper analyses one such example in the case of Nott the Brave, a character in Critical Role’s popular second campaign. Nott’s narrative arc, taking place over several hundred hours of gameplay, is a site of racialized play, problematizing simple narratives of representation and identity. This article employs textual analysis and semiotics in examining Nott’s racialization as a Goblin character. I draw heavily on Jenkins’s (2004) notion of gameplay as narrative architecture in considering the limits that racialized play allows the cast of Critical Role. In doing so, I offer insights into how tabletop roleplaying games actual plays might add nuance to debates surrounding narrative and gameplay in roleplaying games, especially as it relates to narratives of White supremacy and domination.","2023-03-20","2023-04-11 15:14:41","2023-11-17 02:01:21","2023-04-11 15:14:36","1-20","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Mark Hines","","","","press-start.gla.ac.uk","","Number: 1","","","","_identity; _dnd; _actual play; _minority; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned","Critical Role; White supremacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He started in the early 1970's designing war-games with the legendary Game Designers' Workshop. He did a bit of everything: he designed wargames; he ran the warehouse; he developed role-playing games when they were still in their infancy. He managed the Twilight: 2000 role-playing line (and authored seventeen of its titles). He contributed to just about every Traveller title GDW published. But Loren's lasting reputation was as editor (starting in 1979) of the Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society for its 24 issues, then for the next 53 issues of Challenge Magazine, and finally for 15 years of the revived JTAS Online. At JTAS Online, Loren wrote more than 400 editorials ranging from the mundane (read: product announcements and plugs) to the sublime (with insights into the game design process, or memories of his days at GDW). These thoughts come to more than 250,000 words; they preserve a unique view of a hobby that barely existed when his work began, and was acknowledged as mainstream as his work ended. Foreword by Steve Jackson. Afterword by Marc Miller. (To be clear, this is an edited reprint of Loren Wiseman's JTAS [at Steve Jackson Games] editorial work).

Néanmoins, cette seule clé n’ouvre pas toutes les portes. Un modèle comme celui de G. Calleja semble plus adapté à l’étude des jeux contemporains. Les six dimensions qu’il explore font apparaître le jeu comme intrinsèquement complexe et non optimal. Sa distinction entre macro- et micro-engagement révèle des formes négligées de la relation au jeu qui se manifestent en dehors des parties. Le modèle MÉDIAL (Moteur, Épreuve, Diégèse, Intrigue, Autrui et Ludologie) reprend l’approche multidimensionnelle de Calleja en y ajoutant deux ambitions. Premièrement, le sous- et le sur-engagement y apparaissent comme des formes socialement problématiques de l’expérience ludique. Deuxièmement, la réflexivité n’est plus traitée comme une distanciation mais considérée comme une dimension à part entière de l’engagement.

A registered exploratory pilot program using offline Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs) to mitigate social anxiety and reduce problematic involvement in multiplayer online videogames","","","","10.17605/OSF.IO/3PGT7","","Background. Gamers with poor self-concept, high social anxiety, and high loneliness are more at risk of problematic involvement in videogames and particularly in massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) than other players. There is a research gap concerning treatment approaches to cater socially anxious gamers with problematic patterns of gaming involvement. This registered exploratory pilot tests the feasibility and initial effect of a structured protocol in which socially anxious online gamers are exposed in offline social skills and exposed to real-life social interactions while playing an offline tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG). Methods. Our structured protocol lasts 10 weeks and involves 10 sessions organized within 3 modules in which participants play a TTRPG inspired from the game “Dungeons and Dragons”. Each module deploys a written role-playing scenario designed to challenge the players in game terms, as well as to involve them in a story based on maturing relationships with other characters and on solving challenges by social means and investigation. Our study uses an experimental multiple single-case design with multiple baselines across groups (4 groups of 5 gamers with sub-clinical problematic videogame use and social anxiety) and a 3-month follow-up. Outcomes assessed include social skills, selfesteem, loneliness, assertiveness, and gaming disorder symptoms. Results. Ethical clearance has been obtained. Data collection is planned to begin on April 1, 2023 and to end in November 2023. Conclusion. Our proof-of-principle study is intended to provide pilot data for use in developing new types of interventions which, given their game-based social nature, may be more accessible and engaging for persons with problematic involvement in online videogames and concomitant social anxiety.","2023-04-13","2023-04-18 16:28:04","2024-02-29 17:42:53","2023-04-18 16:22:42","","","","","","","Can playing Dungeons and Dragons be good for you?","","","","","","Songdo Convensia, Incheon, South Korea","en","","","","","osf.io","","https://osf.io/8g6wr https://osf.io/hzyva","","","","_mental disorder; _therapy; _dnd; _preprint; _anxiety; _data; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _problematic; _empirical work; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICBA2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, deficit understandings of disability persist in educational settings and neurodivergent people continue to face disadvantage and discrimination in organisations constructed on normative understandings of the world. Although New Literacy Studies is concerned with ideas of power, dominance and worth, there is a notable lack of work that connects NLS with issues of neurodiversity. In this paper, I introduce the term ‘neurodivergent literacies’ to propose a field of study that links the ideological model of literacy with the neurodiversity paradigm. From this starting point, I outline a project that examined literacies around what are often referred to as the ‘special interests’ of autistic people. Presenting data from interviews with 13 neurodivergent adults, related to school experiences and the literacies they engage with around their self-defined ‘ruling passions’, I make recommendations for literacies practitioners, arguing that schools need to do more to take account of difference and disability. By describing how ‘neurodivergent literacies’ can help teachers harness their own critical literacy skills to challenge deficit models of difference in the classroom, this paper illuminates how an understanding of neurodiversity is essential for anyone teaching and researching literacies with a commitment to social justice.","2023","2023-04-23 01:03:54","2023-09-18 14:15:38","2023-04-23 01:03:10","","","n/a","n/a","","","‘Neurodivergent literacies’","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/lit.12320","","","","_autism; _reading; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","neurodivergence; neurodiversity; social justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A research gap exists as TTRPG in Singapore, a new but growing imported Western game model has not caught the attention of scholars. In-depth qualitative interviews with 15 players revealed that players in Singapore subscribe to similar traits of good gamer, as Western players. It also contributes to understanding how these traits are ranked and what behaviours discourage future play between players. Our study revealed that there are tensions between the cooperative nature of the game vis-à-vis the competitive spirit of players, as evident from traits of bad gamers described by our respondents. Our study also contributes to the field of roleplay studies by showing how TTRPG is played and why it is a growing phenomenon by explaining how it differs from online gaming. We argue that gaming presents an interesting window into societal values, beyond the reported benefits of TTRPG in education and socialization.

The main theory behind it is Content Gamification (which focuses on making a module’s content more fun), and tabletop role-playing games combined with rules from the “Betrayal at the house on the hill” board game. The framework itself is called “Code-Playing Technique” and it directly combines physical role-play and learning programming. This is a learning technique designed for use in Software Engineering and Game Programming curricula. With the “Code-Playing Technique”, students may express themselves through coding instead of via words or natural language. As such, during role-playing a character in a virtual setting, anything that the player does and anything that happens to that character must be expressed through programming and scripting from within a game engine.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of employing AI techniques in designing a virtual dungeon master (VDM) on the gameplay experience of D&D players. The VDM utilizes Open AI’s GPT2 model to generate story prompts in combination with an input plausibility checker, a dice rolling feature, and a candidate story prompt scorer. Feedback from D&D players revealed that the VDM is capable of producing believable fantasy stories but lacks consistency in the quality of its generated stories.

We present FIREBALL, a large dataset containing nearly 25,000 unique sessions from real D\&D gameplay on Discord with true game state info.

Looking at campaigns from two YouTube series, Critical Role and High Rollers, I identify the network of interactions required by the performers, including “in-character” performances, “out of character” interactions, and liminal components of the game, such as rolling dice to determine in-game events. After establishing the boundaries of these mental spaces, I focus on instances where these spaces blend, such as pop culture references being used in-game, to demonstrate the necessity of a Discourse Viewpoint Space, a “higher-level discourse space” within which multiple viewpoints can be reconciled (Dancygier & Vandelanotte 2017, p. 570). Understanding the flow of multiple discourse spaces in a setting such as a role-playing game is driven by complex viewpoint networks, and can partly be identified through the features of speech (such as using an accent when in character). By focusing on instances of unexpected merging of character and player, my paper analyzes the means by which players integrate multiple viewpoints when playing D&D, and how this integration is necessary to strengthen what Banks et al. (2018) refer to as player-avatar relationships.","2023","2023-05-08 15:56:29","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","HHU","Düsseldorf","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_dnd; _oral communication; _conversation; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","“Modeling Language and Cognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is anecdotal and emerging academic evidence that RPGs can promote personal growth of participants in both academic and therapeutic settings. However, it has been challenging to capture the impact of RPGs on learning in classrooms. We submit that this is because both the term “RPG” and the term “learning” are too broad. There are myriad RPGs available, with different skill sets required to play. Similarly, there are many different types of learning an educator may be looking to develop in their students. Building on the 1983 work of Gary Alan Fine, the 2008 work of Klabbers, and the 2011 work of Mariais, Michau and Pernin, we propose two things. The first is a schema describing the structures of an RPG within the educational context. The second is a matrix is designed to identify the kinds of learning that an educator wants to promote in students through use of Learning Role-playing Games (LRPGs) (Mariais, Michau, and Pernin 2012), then match that learning to specific elements within an RPG that will support those objectives. Educational objectives include specific content learning; social emotional skills such as turn taking or teamwork; executive functioning skills; math fluency; and reading skills. Future work will include application of this conceptual framework to actual classroom settings and potential use in therapeutic settings.","2023-05-15","2023-05-16 13:00:05","2023-09-18 14:14:50","2023-05-16 13:00:05","7-17","","13","","","","Gaming the Systems","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Maryanne Cullinan, Jennifer Genova","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 13","","","","_peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","education; conceptual framework; growth; learning objectives; learning role-playing games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

My work focuses on the concept of reparative play, an adaptation of reparative reading which was first proposed by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick in 1995 (Sedgwick 2003). Reparative reading explores alternatives to heteronormative ideals through the act of reading. Instead of getting caught up in the problematic implications of a text, the alternatives are foregrounded (Sedgwick 2003, 137). Reparative play then expands reparative reading into the realm of play, where one explores the possibility for a sustainable queer livelihood through play (Vist 2018). I conclude with an observation of safety tools designed for tabletop RPGs, that enable reparative play.This work will be posited alongside an autoethnographic reflection of my own role-play experience as a means of demonstrating reparative play in practice. My work is founded on Sedgwick’s (2003) Touching Feeling, Kara Stone’s (2018) “Time and Reparative Game Design,” and Sarah Lynne Bowman’s (2010) The Functions of Role-Playing Games. These scholars observe role-play as a method of queer performativity and identity exploration. I propose that through the embodiment of a D&amp;D character, set in a more accepting world, the players can enact reparative play to give an accurate and positive representation of themselves while promoting alternatives to heteronormative culture.","2023-05-15","2023-05-16 13:00:05","2023-09-18 14:14:50","2023-05-16 13:00:05","79-88","","13","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Giuseppe Femia","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 13","","","","_peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned","Dungeons & Dragons; asexuality; emancipatory bleed; queer identities; reparative play","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While Foucault provides a genealogy of religious and philosophical examples of these technologies of the self, those familiar with role-playing games (RPGs) recognize that their practice also meets these criteria. Even though most people play RPGs for entertainment and escapism, they are potentially transformative (Kemper 2020; Bowman and Hugaas 2021), especially erotic-horror RPGs, like Vampire: The Masquerade (VtM) (Davis et al. 1992).This essay will explain how RPGs function as a type of truth game and how they can be understood as technologies of the self when played to achieve transformative bleed. It will also use Foucault’s thought to explain how some RPGs, like VtM, are better suited for transformative bleed because their technology of signs, i.e., the setting and rules that define meaning within the game, enable the development of more psychologically complex characters through game mechanics inspired by Jungian depth psychology (Bowman 2010; Beltrán 2012, 2013). Finally, my most recent character, Robin Alecto, Robin Alecto, will be used as a case study of how the game mechanics of VtM function as a technology of the self.","2023-05-15","2023-05-16 13:00:05","2023-11-28 17:44:48","2023-05-16 13:00:05","89-97","","13","","","","The Vampire Foucault","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Albert R.

Outlining the core concepts of creative experience, experience design, and gamification, along with the associated role of phenomenology and embodied cognition, the project establishes a case for the intersectionality of these elements in understanding how to develop creativity. Expanding further, the project explores what existing literature shows about TRPG ability to exercise and develop cognitive, psychological, sociological, and emotional competencies through unique elements like narrative, immersion, transference of experience, and skill acquisition. This project posits that the unique manifestation of these inherent elements is what differentiates TRPGs as a creative experience tool unmatched by other training approaches. The outcomes of this project identify how existing TRPGs might be modified to maximize the effect of character creation, game mechanics, and the role of the Game Master to start exploring and testing the effectiveness for developing creativity skills and creative experience identifiers. Additionally, the outcomes include a brief description of the need to expand research in this area, with three initial suggestions for research opportunities that address gaps in existing knowledge and open doors for more research on creativity and the creative experience.","2023-05-01","2023-05-19 21:03:41","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","94","","","","","","","","","","Buffalo State College","","en","","Creative Studies Graduate Student Master's Projects","","","","","","","","","_creativity; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little research exists to describe how players of a game construct and uphold pragmatic norms during gameplay. Using a synthesis of conversation analysis and frame analysis techniques, this study seeks to understand how one group of professional gamers navigates conversational turn-taking during gameplay. 1.5 hours of gameplay conversation was transcribed using Jeffersonian transcription, and twelve selected segments of the transcript were analyzed based on framing, use of character voices, and overlapping talk. Results indicate that turn-taking is weakly affected by use of character voice and performance, as well as affected by strong emotions and the narrative significance of each utterance. Individual tendencies regarding overlapping talk are not uniform across a group but are not necessarily punished for not conforming to an overall norm. This study stands as a unique example of how conversation analysis and frame analysis can be used in conjunction to analyze the conversational norm-building of a social group.","2023","2023-05-19 21:08:28","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","84","","","","","","","","","","San Francisco State University","San Francisco, CA","en","","Master of Science In Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences","","","Zotero","","","","","","_oral communication; _conversation; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we frame D&D specifically as a dialogue system challenge, where the tasks are to both generate the next conversational turn in the game and predict the state of the game given the dialogue history. We create a gameplay dataset consisting of nearly 900 games, with a total of 7,000 players, 800,000 dialogue turns, 500,000 dice rolls, and 58 million words. We automatically annotate the data with partial state information about the game play. We train a large language model (LM) to generate the next game turn, conditioning it on different information. The LM can respond as a particular character or as the player who runs the game--i.e., the Dungeon Master (DM). It is trained to produce dialogue that is either in-character (roleplaying in the fictional world) or out-of-character (discussing rules or strategy).

J.R.R. Tolkien's inclusion of stereotypes, racial coding, and occasional explicit bigotry in his highly influential work has led to today's often controversial fantasy genre. Two such controversies regarding race and fantasy occurred in 2022: one came in the form of racist backlash to the reveal of Black actors playing elf, dwarf, and harfoot roles in Amazon Prime Video's new Tolkien-based television show The Rings of Power, and the other occurred when fans rallied against the inclusion of racist descriptor text in the ""hadozee"" character option released as part of the Dungeons & Dragons ""Spelljammer"" expansion. In this thesis, I examine these two controversies from an ideological perspective for the purpose of contextualizing the various fan cultures involved within the broader framework of an ideological culture war. First, I define Tolkien fans as reactionary fandom and Dungeons & Dragons fans as activist fandom. From there, I present a method through which both The Rings of Power and the Spelljammer expansion can be viewed as fan works in their own right. Then, I establish stakes by examining the problematic history of race in fantasy which has set a racist status quo. Following that, I analyze fandom activity surrounding the two controversies, including both the texts themselves and fan reactions to them. I conclude that the fans involved use fandom as a means by which they can express deeper held beliefs. Ultimately, the goal of this thesis is to investigate that relationship between fandom activity and ideology through the lens of racial controversy in the fantasy genre.","2023","2023-05-23 15:19:25","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-05-23 15:17:00","","98","","","","","","","","","","Drew University","Madison","en","","B.A. Media and Communications","","","","","","","","","_fandom; _minority; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on how storytelling serves as an educational tool to impart cultural lessons and values to construct a shared understanding, and how building upon a shared understanding is crucial in building stronger and healthier systems of interaction within communities. The paper proposes that the unique incarnation of storytelling in TTRPGs can function as a conduit for transformative learning and development to occur within communities. Through the immersive and collaborative storytelling of TTRPGs, players can learn to work together, solve problems, and develop new perspectives on the world around them. This, in turn, can lead to personal growth and a deeper sense of community and connection. The paper concludes that by embracing these tools of education and transformation, we can build a brighter future for all.","2023","2023-05-23 15:22:13","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","155","","","","","","","","","","University of Guelph","Guelph","en","","MS Environmental Design and Rural Development","","","","","","","","","_TTRPG; _transformative; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

TTRPGs have begun to increase in popularity and evoke new interest in exploring whether these new treatment modalities result in positive mental health outcomes. Specifically, therapeutically applied role-playing games (TARPGs) are TTRPGs that integrate therapeutic mechanisms in order to promote improved psychological and social functioning. The goal of the present study was to examine and understand the outcomes of TARPGs for psychological and social functioning in youth/young adult populations utilizing participant and parent data. Data was collected as part of quality improvement procedures from a nonprofit organization and were obtained for the purpose of the present study. Results revealed small decreases on measures of empathy (d = 0.43) and self-esteem (d = 0.24) for youth. Evaluation of parents indicated that no changes were observed on the measured scores. Results from the present study, while limited, still yielded important implications for the utility of TARPGs for youth/young adult populations. Future research should continue to expand the limited research on TARPGs as a clinical intervention to determine the efficacy of TARPGs as an evidence supported intervention.","2023-05-01","2023-05-23 15:30:58","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","81","","","","","","","","","","California State University, San Bernardino","San Bernardino","en","","Master of Science in Clinical/Counseling Psychology","","","","","","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Il constitue le premier succès qui distingue immédiatement le jeu de rôle (sur table) en tant que catégorie de jeux à part entière, différente des wargames dont il est au départ une variation. Une communauté de joueurs se développe et devient rapidement très importante, ce qui incite la publication d’autres jeux de cette catégorie (Tékumel, Tunnels & Trolls, Chivalry & Sorcery, Traveller, Runequest...). Cinquante ans plus tard, en 2024, les jeux de rôle sont fortement présents au sein de l’offre ludique (Appelcline, 2014). D’autres communautés de joueurs se sont formées et des controverses, propres à cette pratique nouvelle touchant de nombreux adolescents, ont vu le jour (Laycock, 2015). Le domaine s’est élargi et les jeux se sont multipliés, touchant à de nombreux genres de la fiction. Les règles ont, elles aussi, évolué et offrent des expériences de jeux variées. Ainsi les jeux de rôle ont-ils fortement marqué les cultures populaires contemporaines depuis leur création, notamment les jeux vidéo dont certains sont fortement inspirés de D&D ou d’autres jeux de rôles, ou les séries télévisées, tout en continuant à progresser et à s’adapter à de nouveaux contextes. Ainsi les JDR n’ont-ils cessé d’être pratiqués, d’évoluer et d’être édités. À l’occasion de cet anniversaire, ce colloque souhaite donc revenir sur les cinq décennies de Dungeons & Dragons et des jeux de rôle et, plus largement, sur l’histoire de ce loisir et sur ses enjeux sociaux et culturels.","2024-03-28","2023-05-23 19:49:55","2024-02-09 15:54:51","2023-05-23 19:48:30","","","","","","","","","","","","","Metz","fr","© Fabula.org, licence Creative Commons Paternité-Pas d'Utilisation Commerciale-Pas de Modification","","","","","","Publisher: Équipe de recherche Fabula, École Normale Supérieure, 45 rue d'Ulm, 75230 Paris Cedex 05","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vous êtes dans une taverne...

While scholarly research has consistently found that women are marginalized in these communities, little research has looked at how men see these communities. Research on homosociality shows that men use communities and relationships with other men to access masculinity (Bird, 1996; Dellinger, 2004; Houston, 2012). Building on game studies and masculinity studies, this research looks at the way men in tabletop roleplaying game communities understand their involvement and the ways their involvement connects with masculinity.

While the descriptions provide imagery and word use to highlight the positive aspects of the characters, the overemphasis signals stereotypes of a conceptual “other.” These characters then become examples of “good Blacks” that differ from “bad” individuals. The positive imagery provokes a stereotype threat, and a need to uphold this “good Black” mentality, lest one becomes the Other.

However, inquiry into the way roleplaying games appear in these titles reveals the way they have been instrumentalized to serve the ends of their respective mediums. Scholars writing about roleplaying games also tend to leap straight to analyses of video games, with many words spilled over World of Warcraft while a live site of analog performance sits before them. In this work, I address the tabletop roleplaying game as a medium with insights to offer Theatre and Performance Studies as an object of study. In this dissertation, I explore the way that tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs) use speech and performance to guide players through conventional practices that allow them to imagine together, safely and respectfully. Here, I show that TTRPGs are a medium whose performance shares many qualities with Theatre. Through these qualities, I construct a framework through which I unpack the event of play, its participants, and the conventions that shepherd it. Interpreting roleplaying as the performance of a series of speech acts, I draw attention to the conventions that allow us to collaborate and imagine together through play. Analyzing on the design of these conventions across a wide variety of these games, I show the way the system of rules created by game designers render explicit the implied social conventions that govern conversation and social interaction. These games design their rules to structure the relationships between players and create tools to promote respectful interaction at the table. This underscores the importance of this site not only for scholarship, but also for practice and pedagogy. Safety tools and the distribution of narrative authority do not merely show that players collaborate, communicate boundaries, and act respectfully and with consent – they show us how. By unpacking rules about safety and consent, and by putting them into practice, theatre practitioners gain a new understanding of what we make, how we work together, and how to move through a social world with safety and respect.","2023-05-24","2023-06-02 13:22:09","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","117","","","","","","","","","","Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College","","en","","PhD School of Theatre","","","","","","","","","_theater; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study utilized an action research approach, involving the creation and development of the game in collaboration with participants for a period of many months, using an iterative, emergent design process that emphasized collaboration and feedback. The research sought to answer the following questions: 1) How can a table-top role-playing game establish and build community among independent community educators? 2) By engaging in an emergent design-informed table-top role-playing game, what kinds of community-building frameworks can be produced by independent community educators playing the game? The game, called ""New School,"" was designed to facilitate communication and connection among educators working in a variety of communities, contexts, and geographic locations. Through a series of playtesting sessions and a reflective feedback loop, the researcher and participants identified key features of the game that supported community-building, including opportunities for storytelling, shared problem-solving, and connection with personal and professional experiences. The findings suggest that the game has potential to serve as a framework for community-building, promoting emergent collaboration and knowledge-sharing among participants.

The game was delivered both physically and digitally to 42 players with unified positive feedback.  TTRPG show potential as a tool for students, in an abstract way, to explore and realise their own employability skills.","2023-05-01","2023-06-09 13:44:46","2023-09-18 14:14:34","2023-06-09 13:42:59","1-20","","1","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","repository.derby.ac.uk","","Accepted: 2023-04-03 Company: Staffordshire University Distributor: Staffordshire University Institution: Staffordshire University Label: Staffordshire University Publisher: 93v4w","","","","_peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _empirical work; _soft skills; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, while players are advancing in the game with the storytelling, character development, acting, improvisation and analysis they are also being entertained in friendly atmosphere. In many cases a good game session is not only a powerful creative tool and a bonding social activity but in many ways it also works as therapy, helping people to get through life with depression, anxiety and trauma.

D&D players are often looking for ways to more effectively track information and products that enhance their game experience. One such product is a custom miniature; players use these to track their character’s location and for the enjoyment of creating a physical representation of their imagination. Virtual Tabletops (VTT’s) were developed to make the entire experience digital. The digital nature of VTT’s make all of the game’s rules and mechanics accessible at the click of the mouse; however, it also alienates players from a physical connection to the game. The smart game board offers digital convenience while preserving the physical connection to the game. The game board wirelessly communicates with the pieces on the board to provide quick access to their specific rules and mechanics while also determining their location on the board. The board utilizes a digital display to swap between different game boards/maps. The smart game board saves time and simplifies the experience for players by displaying only the most relevant information and it enhances their experience by utilizing their custom miniatures. This makes the game more accessible to beginners, reduces risk of error for the game master and allows everyone to focus more on enjoying the game. This product could easily be adapted to accommodate any board game with pieces large enough to contain wireless communication technology. Future developments of this product could also include an automatic board setup feature if the piece has a known board layout such as chess, checkers, or monopoly.","2023-06-01","2023-06-26 13:56:34","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","58","","","","","","","","","","Cal Poly, College of Engineering, Electrical Engineering Department","San Luis Obispo","en","","BS in Electrical Engineering","","","","","","","","","_virtual table; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design in question drew from prior work in games, films, and other narrative works with time skips, based on the assumption that time skips can have a great emotional impact, but that impact may be lesser or greater depending on how it is handled. I based the design on a theoretical framework which suggested that roleplaying games would be more impactful given a deep immersion into the reality of the gameworld, and specifically a sense that time’s passage in the gameworld realistically reflected the way humans experience time in the real world. As such, the game was built to reflect specific theories regarding the human processes of memory and aging. The tabletop roleplaying game ran over the course of three 2.5-hour sessions over several weeks, with three participants roleplaying pre-built characters who aged with the time skip that occurred between sessions. Following the final session, I moderated a focus group interview to collect data about the emotional impact of the experience. Generally, the game did have a profound emotional impact. I found that the most impactful game elements were those which highlighted change on several levels; in particular, mechanics and narrative moments which emphasized character growth – or losses which characters had undergone – were very effective. Though this study used a tabletop roleplaying game as its medium, the design was built to be general enough that certain findings could be tested with other mediums as well, which I explore in the discussion section.","2023","2023-06-26 13:58:38","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-06-26 13:58:38","","85","","","","","","","","","","Uppsala University, Disciplinary Domain of Humanities and Social Sciences, Faculty of Arts, Department of Game Design","","en","","Master's Programme in Game Design","","","www.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

D&D and other TTRPGs set themselves apart from other games by allowing for a massive amount of freedom both in character creation and in-game choices, both of which are a massive appeal for the player base. However, this also allows for conflict not only between the players, but also between the characters they create. This project examines 126 cases of player character conflict gathered through a survey. Physical or material harm to player characters perpetrated by another player character, as treatment of non-playable characters (NPCs), and differences in mission plans were common triggers for conflict. Players tended to enjoy conflict more when it resulted in positive outcomes for themselves and their characters. They tended to dislike conflict when it was the result of a repeated issue.","2023-05-26","2023-06-26 14:05:46","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","42","","","","","","","","","","Portland State University","","en","","Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Communication and University Honors","","","","","DOI:10.15760/honors.1350","","","","_conflict; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study we report on the development of a serious game (a card-based role-playing game) using Brazilian folk heroes aimed to develop critical thinking skills to empower vulnerable communities affected by misinformation and fake news. Four groups located in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) participated in this research: one group of people experiencing homelessness; two groups of favela residents (one urban and one in the suburbs) and one group of recyclable material collectors from a cooperative. We gained entry and built trust with each of these groups and worked together for 10 months during the pandemic. We conducted participatory observations, individual interviews with each participant and discussed their daily interaction with information, specifically in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. The analyses of the observations and interview data gave us a glimpse of the communicative needs of the groups. Inserting players into a narrative where they can make decisions based on critical thinking and their own reflections on the pandemic was important for building knowledge and developing critical thinking in these communities. The nature of the game (interactive and cooperative) allowed participants to focus on problem-solving skills and group work. It encouraged them to use real-life knowledge and skills to solve the fictional problems presented by the narrative.","2023-06-20","2023-06-26 14:08:52","2023-09-18 14:15:38","2023-06-26 14:08:37","101354","","","","","Thinking Skills and Creativity","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","_information literacy; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","Diverse literacy levels; empirically driven materials, serious games, folk culture, vulnerable communities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While the world of Iad and the Free States of Tarvan does not exist on planet earth, the experiences and emotions felt by the players and their characters within the world are very much real. Players use extensions of themselves, their characters, to interact with the world around them, forging relationships and new lines of fate and destiny. Characters are fractals of their out of game personas, attached to one’s base personality and expanding outwards. The development of a character is heavily influenced by a player’s own history and frame of reference, but also the ritual of immersion. Immersion is the core part of this process, allowing players and their Dungeon Master to jump between the two worlds interchangeably. These worlds run parallel and simultaneously with each other during campaign sessions, allowing players to interact with both. At the end of the day, the DnD group Cantrips and Chaos has fostered a subcultural dynamic that functions at two different levels. Players have the unique capability of developing characters that reflect themselves and directly impact a world that is different from their own in meaningful, and sometimes truly chaotic ways.","2023-04-28","2023-06-26 14:28:11","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","44","","","","","Dungeons & Dragons","","","","","University of Richmond","","en","","BA Honors Theses, Sociology","","","","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tabletop roleplaying game provoked a new form of textual engagement: it entangled the fantastic tales of early 20th Century pulp fiction with the practice of play. The tabletop role-playing game initiated new perspectives on how classic texts could not only be read but also played. Our contemporary world is becoming increasingly gamified: digital media applications (from mobile phones to the personal home computer) have embedded game elements, structures, processes, and lexicons in our modern lives. Tabletop role-playing was a herald for, and catalyst, of this contemporary phenomenon. Espen Aarseth notes that tabletop role-playing games can be considered as an early from of the “cybertext,” a text that requires “non-trivial” effort for its engagement, and is “the oral predecessor to computerized, written, adventure games.” The project of this dissertation offers an approach of examining and understanding the practice of tabletop role-playing through Karen Barad’s concept of agential realism. Agential realism is based on concepts of Niels Bohr’s “Copenhagen Interpretation” of quantum phenomenon and its premise that nothing can be observed without changing what is observed. Agential realism requires us to accept and acknowledge our complicity in the creation, physical and sociocultural, of the realities which surround, bound, and interpellate us. This dissertation complicates the notion of singular authorship of isolated texts and realities by examining all the relationships necessary to produce a tabletop roleplaying game text. The first chapter of this dissertation introduces the concepts of agential realism while the second offers the historical context for the emergence of tabletop role-playing games. The third chapter analyzes the affective and aesthetic inspirations for Dungeons & Dragons to consider the conditions for the emergence of the first commercial tabletop role-playing game and how it would reconfigure the pulp and classic mythologies that inspired it. In the fourth chapter, I examine the rules for Traveller, an early science fiction tabletop role-playing game directly inspired by the practice of Dungeons & Dragons play, to consider how the procedural mechanics of games impact their authorship. The fifth chapter analyzes another mode of authorship for the role-playing game by analyzing its actual play; in this chapter, I examine specific game sessions from a campaign of the tabletop role-playing game, Call of Cthulhu. Throughout these chapters, we understand how the tabletop role-playing game text, like our physical and sociocultural realities, exist within states of radical possibility. Each mode of authorship, through a text’s inspiration, mechanical construction, and subjective interpretation are observations that fix the tabletop role-playing text into a specific manifestation – thought it may exist within any a priori of an observation. This dissertation advocates for an approach to consider realities, within and beyond the games we play, not as isolated moments of objective experience, but as the inevitable consequences of entanglements with all the authors (and players) that share them.","2023","2023-06-26 14:34:04","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-06-26 14:33:53","","312","","","","","Agential Fantasy","","","","","The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee","","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. English","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798379596729","","","","_agency; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned","Agential realism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"WAWAXH9J","thesis","2023","Johansson, Jonathan","From Dracula to Dungeons & Dragons: Female Ideals across Time and Medium","","","","","https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-217777","The Dungeons & Dragons module Ravenloft (1983) uses the novel Dracula (1897) to create a new story for a new format and while the texts are set during different timeperiods, they both respond in similar ways to the women’s movements of their time. Dracula corresponds to the rise of the New Woman in the 1800s and Ravenloft came out during what is described as a time of “backlash” against the women’s movement ofthe 1970s. This essay uses this historical context and transmediation to compare and analyze the two works and show how they both use idealized female characters, with adaptation to their respective time periods, to impose limitations on female independence and autonomy. The ideals in both works are competent female characters whose safety and wellbeing are still predicated on their relationships to the men in theirlives. By contrast, female characters who strive for independence and power face punishment and death from the narrative. In this way both works espouse a singular ideal way to exist as a woman and that any step outside of this inevitably leads to hardship and suffering.","2023","2023-06-26 14:36:16","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-06-26 14:35:15","","","","","","","From Dracula to Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons","","","","","Stockholm University","Stockholm","en","","BA English","","","su.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_dnd; _gender; _horror; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tabletop RPGs present an invaluable resource for ongoing civic formation by encouraging deliberation and consensus building across shared goals and circumstances. Philosopher John Dewey emphasized that democracy is defined by the civic habits and collective action, not formal governance structures. The experience of playing tabletop RPGs can cultivate habitus and space for future and current citizens to practice democratic skills and commitments. Therefore, these games are a means that align with the ends of a civic life that is rooted in an understanding of democracy beyond just a form of governance, and instead, as a process and interactions of a community. Understood this way, tabletop role-playing games can facilitate a ludic pedagogy of democratic civic life. This approach is not just focused on using novel tools to deliver information or a gamified approach to learning. Instead, it calls for an autotelic approach to citizenship formation that prioritizes committed collaboration with others, imaginative and emergent approaches to problem solving, and the ability to critically negotiate systems of power.","2023","2023-06-27 13:30:53","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-06-27 13:28:58","","227","","","","","Dungeons & Dragons & Dewey","","","","","Loyola University Chicago","Chicago","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Education","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798379723910","","","","_philosophy; _dnd; _politics; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","Dewey; Democracy; Civic education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Further, the project juxtaposed D&D and interaction design as practices to examine if D&D can contribute to interaction design. The project adopted research through design methodology and applied different methods, emphasizing playful and movement-based approaches. A handful of tangible electronic prototypes were created using Arduino Nano BLE Sense, gesture recognition combined with a NeoPixel Circle, a Humidifier, and a Vibration motor combined with 3D-printed objects. The prototypes were tested during a D&D playing session to evaluate their impact on the roleplaying experience. The result of the project suggests that interactive tangible artifacts enhance the experiential, expressive, and sensory qualities of roleplaying in D&D by adding interactivity and tangibility. Furthermore, the results suggest that the playthings increase the player's connection to their character. Finally, the project's result suggests that interaction design can learn from D&D's playful and creative nature by adopting the Magic Circle concept to interaction design methodology.","2023","2023-06-27 13:34:32","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-06-27 13:32:59","","62","","","","","Weapons of Microcontroller Destruction","","","","","Malmö University","","en","","Master Interaction Design","","","mau.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Little did they know that their humble box set of three small digest-sized booklets would spawn an entire industry practically overnight. In Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground, Stu Horvath explores how the hobby of roleplaying games, commonly known as RPGs, blossomed out of an unlikely pop culture phenomenon and became a dominant gaming form by the 2010s. Going far beyond D&D, this heavily illustrated tome covers more than three hundred different RPGs that have been published in the last five decades. Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground features (among other things) bunnies, ghostbusters, soap operas, criminal bears, space monsters, political intrigue, vampires, romance, and, of course, some dungeons and dragons. In a decade-by-decade breakdown, Horvath chronicles how RPGs have evolved in the time between their inception and the present day, offering a deep and gratifying glimpse into a hobby that has changed the way we think about games and play. The deluxe edition will include a foil-stamped cover and slipcase with a cloth binding, a ribbon, gilded edges, and an 8.5x11-inch card stock poster of the regular edition.","2023","2023-06-29 13:47:31","2023-11-28 17:48:32","2023-06-29 13:45:23","","456","","","","","","","","","","MIT Press","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; _pbta; =cleaned; _wod; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As game-based approaches are effective interventions in treating anxiety and depression, we propose to explore the use of a multiplayer role-playing game (RPG) as a potential intervention for social isolation, anxiety, and depression. Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the feasibility of using Masks, a multiplayer RPG, as an intervention for social isolation, anxiety, and depression in adolescents with CPMCs; (2) evaluate the viability of the research process; and (3) gauge participation in and engagement with RPG-based interventions. Methods: This study is a remote synchronous game-based intervention for adolescents with CPMCs aged 14-19 years. Eligible participants completed a web-based baseline survey to assess anxiety, depression, and social isolation and to identify their gaming habits. After completing the baseline survey, they participated in 5 moderated Masks game sessions. In Masks, players assume the roles of young superheroes; select their character types, superpowers; and perform actions determined by the game’s rule system and dice rolls. All game sessions were played using Discord, a communication platform commonly used by gaming communities. Games were led and moderated by game masters (GMs). After each game session, participants completed surveys to assess changes in anxiety, depression, and social isolation, and their attitude toward the game and the user experience. The participants also completed an exit survey after all 5 game sessions (modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, and 17 open-ended questions). The GMs rated each game session and reported on gameplay, player behavior, comfort, and engagement levels of the players. Results: As of March 2020, six participants were recruited for the pilot study to participate in moderated web-based game sessions of Masks; 3 completed all game sessions and all required assessments. Although the number of participants was too low to draw generalizable conclusions, self-reported clinical outcomes did seem to indicate a positive change in depression, anxiety, and social isolation symptoms. Qualitative analysis of postgame survey data from participants and GMs indicated high levels of engagement and enjoyment. Furthermore, the participants provided feedback about improved mood and engagement related to weekly participation in Masks. Lastly, responses to the exit survey showed interest in future RPG-related studies. Conclusions: We established a workflow for gameplay and evaluated a research protocol for evaluating the impact of RPG participation on isolation, anxiety, and depression symptoms in adolescents with CPMCs. Preliminary data collected from the pilot study support the validity of the research protocol and the use of RPG-based interventions in larger clinical studies.

"9DS3W9CU","thesis","2023","Osmond, William James","A Politics of Participation and Representation in Live Action Roleplaying","","","","","https://surrey.primo.exlibrisgroup.com","This thesis examines the practice of live action roleplay (larp) in terms of the distributions of power, agency and authority that inhere to it. It asks how experiences and stories are constituted in larping through collaborative participation, and what representations of Others’ experiences have to do with their grounds. It addresses these concerns by developing an autoethnographic methodology that utilises practical experiences of larping in analysing the political relationships that become between the player and both their co-players and those whose experiences they represent through their play. This analysis uses aspects of Whitehead’s philosophy of organism as a theoretical framework. The research therefore constitutes a practice-led theoretical study into the politics of playing together and of playing the lives of Others. The thesis argues for an interpretation of larping as a ‘methektic’ performance paradigm as well as a practice of ‘listening’ to the experiences of Others. Practically, the thesis investigates my experiences of playing in four international larps: La Sirena Varada, College of Wizardry, Inside Hamlet and Legion: Siberian Story. In each case study I look at a different aspect of participation and representation. Firstly, I look at how my experiences are constituted through my togetherness with other players; secondly, how dramaturgy and its playful counterpart, ludaturgy, affect experiences of roleplaying and story-making; thirdly, whether the representation of extreme experience as experience is possible; and finally, whether larped experience can foster empathy with historical others. Through these analyses, the thesis suggests that the most valuable insights larping offers come from participation in the practice rather than the representation of characters and actions, and that participation supersedes representation as a mode of engagement in this practice.","2023-06-06","2023-07-05 08:06:10","2024-01-10 02:36:24","2023-07-04 20:39:13","","","","","","","https","","","","","Guildford School of Acting, University of Surrey","Guildford, GB","en","Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0 International, Open, © Willoh Osmond 2023","ETD-Doctoral","","","","","DOI 10.15126/thesis.900741","","","","_theater; =cleaned; _LARP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thrill of being able act within a story motivates children’s embodied agency to physically explore an immersive set installation and acts of creative writing performed during the story experience, which allow children to co-create the narrative alongside the adult practitioners. These acts are fictionalised into the narrative frame of the children as heroic story writers, offering new perspectives on how child co-creation of adult narratives can be enabled intra-textually, within the bounds of the adult-initiated story, rather than extra-textually after it has finished, as is the case with fan fiction. However, it raises questions about the nature and limits of this co-creative agency the experiences purport to elicit from their child participants, especially in terms of their critical agency to manipulate fictional devices presented to them through such a hyper-real aesthetic. Drawing on theories of children’s literature and participatory performance, this article argues that it is the way these immersive productions uncannily overlay real and fictional temporalities that enables the child participants’ critical agency within them. Approaches for further participatory, practice-based research in this understudied corner of children’s reading universes are suggested for harnessing the potential of immersive story worlds to generate research data from within children’s first aesthetic engagement with stories.","2023-06-15","2023-07-05 13:36:37","2023-09-18 14:12:18","2023-07-05 13:36:20","","","","","","Child Lit Educ","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","_literature; _theater; _collaborative; _embodiment; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _empirical work; _LARP; _LEARNING","Embodiment; Agency; Children’s literature; Co-creation; Immersive theatre; Participatory research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first chapter examines the origins of D&D by looking closer at rules in the pamphlets written by Gary Gygax and some of the games’ supplements like published through The Dragon magazine. The characterization rules used in original D&D can be recognized as characterization by role, a term used by Uri Margolin in his theory of character. This type of characterization can be seen in literature inspired by the game, as seen in Quag Keep by Andre Norton. The author uses many of the rules provided by the game, and further builds on the problematic aspects of the game like misogyny and racist systems. The second chapter examines the overarching narrative in the core rulebooks of Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition. I argue that this narrative has connections to stereotypes, clichés, and tropes found in the genre of sword and sorcery, and that this narrative is forced onto the players as the main world of D&D. This limits the narrative freedom of the players, and authors who decide to write novels in the general world of D&D as seen in the novels Vox Machina: Kith & Kin by Marieke Nijkamp, and Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree.

Contemporary education research identifies RPGs as robust examples of school-based and extra-academic literacy practices. As sites of narrative possibility and precarity, RPGs are political projects that can resist and reify hegemonic ideologies of race, gender, and power. In this three-paper dissertation, I build upon game studies and literacy scholarship to nuance the ways six youth participants coauthored worlds, negotiated storytelling practices, and (re)produced Whiteness. In Paper 1, I highlight a phenomenon I call “liminal play” – moments of gameplay wherein the boundaries between players, characters, and texts converge. My findings illustrate how liminal moments of play forward social and compositional dimensions of collaborative storytelling. In Paper 2, I leverage conversation analysis to detail how participants’ play-based talk oscillated across two participation frames: the game (i.e., their character roles) and the metagame (i.e., their player roles). My analysis examines the nested and contested processes of narrative negotiation inherent in RPG interactions. Finally, in Paper 3, I interrogate how participants’ worldbuilding practices resisted and reified White racialized ideology. Oriented by critical Whiteness studies, I unmask how participants and I privileged Whiteness despite our efforts to resist hegemonic Dungeons & Dragons lore.","2023","2023-07-24 17:37:34","2024-02-09 15:47:29","2023-07-24 17:35:08","","130","","","","","Collaborative Worldbuilding","","","","","Boston College","","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D. Teaching, Curriculum and Society","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798379793449","","","","_identity; _fandom; _worldbuilding; _dnd; _collaborative; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING","Role-playing games; Literacy; Coauthorship; Education research; Worldbuilding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a historical-comparative as well as contrastive study, in which terms referring to archetypal character classes present in fantasy creations are recognized, classified and investigated with regard to their etymologies, and English-Polish equivalents are juxtaposed to assess their semantic relatedness. The material basis consists of lexemes excerpted from 11 famous and influential fantasy games, including tabletop role-playing games, video games and a board game set in exomimetic fantasy universes. Character classes present in more than two of these sources were deemed archetypal, resulting in 28 English and 33 Polish archetypal character class terms which are divided into three categories based on the Trio trope, a trope frequently found in fiction and especially present in fantasy genre and in PRGs. The categories are: spellcaster characters, further divided into primary and secondary spellcaster characters; fighter characters; and rogue characters. The lexemes are arranged into pairs (or threes or more) of Polish-English equivalents denoting the same character class concept; these are compared in terms of their etymology and semantic relatedness. Subsequently, lexemes belonging to each category are assessed in terms of their origin and original semantic concept lying at their base. The dissertation is divided into three main chapters: the first chapter functions as an introduction and a theoretical basis for the study, outlining the main assumptions of etymological and historical-comparative studies, as well as characterising fantasy as a genre. Furthermore, the results of a short verifying questionnaire are presented, which was carried out to assess whether character class terms are in fact considered characteristic of fantasy genre by the wider public, which they are. The questionnaire also supplied other words connected with fantasy which might be interesting to investigate for the purpose of a potential future Etymological Dictionary of Fantasy Vocabulary. The second, methodological chapter, describes the corpus, the methods used and the structure of the entries for each lexeme’s etymology. Together they form the theoretical basis for the third, analytical chapter in which etymologies of the character class terms are presented, compared and contrasted. The analysis showed that not all of the investigated lexemes have exact semantic equivalents in either Polish or English and that translating some of the lexemes is not free of predicaments. There are some lexemes which have more than one equivalent in either Polish or English and it is not entirely clear which one is semantically closer to the one it is supposed to translate. The primary spellcasters category is especially problematic in terms of inconsistency in translating these character class terms into Polish, what proved to be widespread not only among the investigated sources, but also in fantasy novels and in dictionaries.

Dagorhir organizers have published multiple game regulations via handbooks with much emphasis on costumes since the 1970s. Dagorhir facilitates community building, identity negotiation and creative storytelling that expands beyond the game through transformative play. In our research, we examine how these costume regulations have influenced fantasy character and real-world identities, how the regulations have influenced perceived costume authenticity over time and how the handbook regulations have engaged with power dynamics related to intersectional identities. We analysed costume-related content in the three handbooks while drawing upon content analysis and historical methods. We found that as the regulations evolved since the 1970s, the rules increasingly centred costumes, indicating the prominence of costume in this escapist community. However, while these spaces centred on the costumed body, Dagorhir regulations reinforced oppressive intersectional norms. Our work has implications for society and business, that is, our findings can help individuals understand why people participate in live-action roleplay, which may reduce stigma surrounding this activity. Additionally, costume producers and retailers can make informed business decisions based upon our findings. Last, live-action roleplay communities can utilize our findings to reject oppressive written and unwritten regulations.","2023-07-20","2023-07-26 13:18:16","2023-09-18 14:14:06","2023-07-26 13:18:16","","","0","0","","","Transformative live-action roleplay and Dagorhir costumes","","","","","","","en","","","","","intellectdiscover.com","","Publisher: Intellect","","","","_cosplay; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Examining D&D as an imaginary, I explore how its mechanics and fiction create categories of race through a process of profiling that produces sumptuary codes, perpetuates a racial hierarchy, invokes racialized accounts of biology, and constitutes a racialized gaze. Through stressing the continuity of this fictional account of race with real world racecraft, I analyze how the fiction of D&D fails to imagine beyond the condition of race. This fiction thereby operates as a mirror that reflects back to us the difficulties of thinking beyond such racial logics, reaffirming the need for continued critique and a reimagining of race.","2023-07-24","2023-07-31 18:25:39","2023-09-18 14:14:34","2023-07-31 18:25:25","1-18","","0","0","","","“Monstrous Adventurers”","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10646175.2023.2238194","","","","_philosophy; _minority; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","philosophy; critical theory; phenomenology; philosophy of games","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The qualitative data was coded using first, second and third order coding with the use of digital coding software Atlas.ti. Of the 12 codes found from the interviews, the “Beyond Part” and the “Player versus Character” themes were examined. My analysis found that players experience the impacts of TTRPG’s beyond the table on both an individual level as well as on a group level. Furthermore the TTRPG’s help players define their identity as far as gender, sexual orientation and other personal identities such as religion. In addition to exploring identity, players also found many therapeutic aspects through the relationship between them as a player and their character. The results found in this research add to the literature exploring the impacts of TTRPG’s and are discussed in terms of their application to areas beyond the hobby as well as future research direction.","2023-04-01","2023-07-31 18:32:10","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","39","","","","","Beyond the Meeple","","","","","Western Washington University","","en","","BA Sociology","","","","","","","","","_identity; _gender; _religion; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Imagining Violence and Reclaiming Indigeneity Through Collaborative Performance","Public Feminisms: From Academy to Community","978-1-64315-043-7","","","","The field of feminist studies grew from the U.S. women's movements of the 1960s and 1970s and has continued to be deeply connected to ongoing movements for social justice. As educational institutions are increasingly seeing public scholarship and community engagement as relevant and fruitful complements to traditional academic work, feminist scholars have much to offer in demonstrating different ways to inform and interact with various communities. In Public Feminisms: From Academy to Community edited by Carrie N. Baker and Aviva Dove-Viebahn, a diverse range of feminist scholar-activists write about the dynamic and varied methods they use to reach beyond the traditional academic classroom and scholarly journals to share their work with the public.    Part one explores how feminist scholars engage broader audiences through art, media, and public programming, including essays on a public discussion series teaching intersectional feminist analysis of popular films, and a podcast from Latina scholars discussing issues of reproductive justice, social justice, motherhood, sexuality, race, and gender. Part two focuses on activism and public education, including essays on ""Take Back the Night,"" and archiving the women's march protests. Part three turns to public writing and scholarship, including an essay on elevating the perspectives and voices of underrepresented creatives in the film and television industry. Part four explores feminist pedagogies for community engagement and for teaching public feminisms.    Accessible and engaging to a broad range of readers, the essays in this volume are a rich resource for scholars and students interested in infusing their academic knowledge into the public sphere. With this timely book, the editors offer an opportunity to reflect on the meaning and importance of community engagement and highlight some of the important public-facing work feminist scholars are doing today. Faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students, as well as administrators hoping to increase their schools' connections to the community, will find this volume indispensable.","2023-06-13","2023-07-31 18:34:41","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Michigan Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5nLMEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=5nLMEAAAQBAJ","=cleaned; _LARP","Social Science / Feminism & Feminist Theory; Social Science / Gender Studies","Baker, Carrie N.; Dove-Viebahn, Aviva","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When examined all together, it becomes clear that there is something more to this entertainment medium than simply watching people play a game, and that the appeal of Critical Role and other live-streamed TTRPG programs owes much to the medium’s ability to leverage the effect of narrative transportation—that feeling of being drawn into a narrative through imagination and empathy for the characters—as well as the intensely collaborative nature of this form of storytelling, which requires participants to make and commit to highly consequential story-changing decisions on the fly. The willingness of players to commit to the “yes, and” of improv transforms the role-playing game into a powerful vehicle for collaborative storytelling, while the unpredictability of real-time dice rolls combined with the inversion of traditional pacing (such that fights that would take only seconds in reality play out over the course of hours) keep viewers and players alike on the edge of their seats for hours at a time, wondering what will happen next.","2017-10","2023-07-31 18:41:12","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Critical Role at the Florida College English Association’s annual conference in 2017 & the national College English Association’s annual conference in 2018","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JCP95665","thesis","2017","Hope, Robyn","Play, Performance, and Participation: Boundary Negotiation and Critical Role","","","","","https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/id/eprint/983446/","Critical Role is a livestreamed spectacle of play, in which eight professional voice actors come together once a week for a session of the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons and Dragons. This show first launched in 2015, and, after one hundred and fifteen episodes spanning nearly four hundred and fifty hours of content, reached the conclusion of its first major narrative arc in October 2017. In this time, the show has attracted a dedicated fanbase of thousands. These fans, known as “Critters”, not only produce creative fanworks, but also undertake massive projects of archiving, timekeeping, transcribing and curating Critical Role. The main project of this thesis is to argue that Critical Role facilitates an ecosystem of ideas, where ideas change hands quickly and fluidly – and, in doing so, it has caused familiar boundaries between author and audience to blur or even collapse. In some cases, this blurring allows for incredible collaborations between fans and performers; at its most challenging, the collapse of familiar author-audience dynamics creates unfamiliar conflicts with no obvious solution. Using Erving Goffman’s model of interactional frame analysis, this thesis will isolate different areas of challenge, collapse, and change. First, it will demonstrate how the dynamics of traditional tabletop roleplaying transform when the roleplayers are put before an audience. The Critical Role cast must negotiate double identities as both players and performers. This thesis will then transition to the behaviour of the audience. The act of watching Critical Role requires a keen understanding of the different frames at work inside the show, and fans have done a considerable amount of work to help each other understand these frames. Finally, this thesis will establish the concept of the fan frame. Both Critters and cast members consider themselves fans in some way. While familiarity with fan culture helps these two groups understand each other, it also creates conflict when the values of fans do not line up with the demands of online content production.","2017-11","2023-07-31 18:42:26","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-07-31 18:42:19","","142","","","","","Play, Performance, and Participation","","","","","Concordia University","","en","term_access","masters","","","spectrum.library.concordia.ca","","","","","","_fandom; _actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an industry like ours, where product release cycles regularly stretch to the half-decade mark at the high end, and even at the low end rarely compress lower than 6 months, a tabletop role playing game can offer creators the opportunity to rapidly iterate on their creative output. More than that, our table offers us the opportunity to test and explore the very essence of the creative process itself. In the era of Twitch and Critical Role, when the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons is growing massively in popularity and profitability, if you haven’t begun exploring this fascinating tool, let me be the first to encourage you to do so. This chapter will explore some of the tabletop role playing games available to you and show examples for integrating procedural generation as a tool into your creator’s toolkit. Finally, we’ll tie it all together by discussing what the experience of creating content through a highly procedural, improv-heavy process can teach us about the nature of player stories, player engagement, and procedural generation’s goals, risks, and successes.","2019","2023-07-31 18:46:32","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","A K Peters/CRC Press","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 12","","","","_procedural storytelling; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is often contributed to the presence of D&D in popular media and of players live-streaming their D&D game online. This form of live-streaming has also garnered popularity online. D&D publisher Wizards of the Coast has also started their own official D&D streaming channel on the platform Twitch. This paper examines the relationship between these official streams and the game itself through the lenses of paratext and transmedia. This allows insight into how these streams extend the game into a new medium and illustrates how these streams can influence the perceptions of the viewer on the game.

This invocation of childlike wonder and possibility, however, reveals a limitation not explicitly stated but nonetheless present at the tables of many players: certain realms of """"adult"""" material are discouraged if not outright forbidden. Tabletop gaming, in general, tends to reflect the confounding American acceptance of violence, even extreme and gruesome violence, while rejecting sexuality and sex almost completely. In this chapter, we explore one way that players and enthusiasts have attempted to resist this aversion and to fulfill their desire to make visible the unspoken erotic possibilities of tabletop roleplay: through the creation of fan fiction. Framing our analysis through Henry   enkins's foundational work on fandoms, Textual Poahners, we examine the works of fan authors in relationship to the boundaries of play offered by the wildly popular actual-play webshow Critical Role and the actual-play podcast The Adventure Zone. Through this analysis, we argue that fan fiction exploring the romantic and sexual adventures of characters from these series acts as a strategy through which fans can circumvent the widespread spread antipathy toward sex and sexuality at the table. We blend the broader definition of a kink as a curve or twist in something otherwise straight with its often colloquial emphasis on eccentricity and peculiarity, especially in sexual practices. We also draw on the work of feminist writer and activist Tristan Taormino, who describes kink as """"an intimate experience, and exchange of power between people that can be physical, erotic, sexual, psychological, spiritual, or, most often, some combination. People who practice kink explore the territory between pleasure and pain, eroticize the exchange of power, experience intense physical sensations and psychological scenarios, and test and push their limits."""" 5 Thus, throughout this chapter these three descriptions of the term """"kink"""" converge and function as an umbrella term for unconventional, non-normative practices. Ultimately, then, this chapter highlights the ways these fan-created texts attempt to resolve the contradiction at the intersection of fantasy gaming and sexual fantasy: namely, the exploration, discovery, and play offered by sex and kink are often forbidden at tables where exploration, discovery, and play would seem to be the.whole point. To begin this discussion, we will turn first to the fraught role of sex and sexuality in tabletop games.""","2019","2023-07-31 18:47:36","2024-02-09 15:49:31","2023-07-31 18:47:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","rowman.com","","","","","","_actual play; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These games often have a fundamental purpose: storytelling. Storytelling has long since been an oral tradition which has been converted into its literary form: books. Books tell us their story without the need of company and are often written by a sole author. However, with more and more Tabletop RPGs coming into popularity, storytelling is reverting back into a collective ritual. However, the story is complicated by chancing the dice, multiple players weighing in on the narrative, and the intrinsic immersive nature of these games. Even so, Tabletop RPGs are now paving the way for a new method of narrative: one that is being created and shaped as the players involve themselves at the table, but also by the luck of the rolls, what backstories each player contributes, and even the music and battlemaps created. Therefore, these methods of storytelling are quickly evolving into a new genre of literacy, featuring immersive and interactive narration alongside multiple-authorship. This type of storytelling, influenced by not only the Game Master, but also the players, battlemaps, and dice, truly becomes a new type of literacy that Crits Different!","2021-05-01","2023-07-31 19:01:29","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","32","","","","","It crits different","","","","","University of Tennessee at Chattanooga","","en","","BA Honor Education","","","","","","","","","_storytelling; _literature; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although, D&D is primarily a game that uses physical components such as paper character sheets or dice, technology has also found its way to it, which is no surprise because current world is full of new technologies. The aim of this work is to examine the motivation of players to play, what role mediation plays, what technologies are used in playing and what are the main differences players perceive in the case of face-to-face session and in the case of online session. Many different technologies are used in both cases. Research questions dealing with these topics are answered through semi-structured interviews with a total of eight players and two participant observations of a player group's session. The most important reasons to play are the social and creative aspects of the game - players play with others, with whom they often form long-term friendships, and enjoy creating and using their imagination to create unique characters, narratives and worlds. D&D is also a source of inspiration for them. The main differences in offline and online game are especially in sociality and opportunities for communication, which is related to the atmosphere and experience, which in the case of face-to-face game...","2021-09-20","2023-07-31 19:01:29","2024-02-09 16:13:59","2023-07-31 18:54:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","cs","","","","","dspace.cuni.cz","","Accepted: 2022-04-14T18:56:50Z Publisher: Univerzita Karlova, Fakulta sociálních věd","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _czechoslovakia; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While TTRPGs have recently been gaining traction, few have assessed the tandem of benefits that participants may gain simultaneously. This study examined the range of benefits for youth involved in therapeutically applied role-playing games (TARPGs), a novel intervention combining therapeutic concepts with TTRPGs. Participants were recruited from a nonprofit organization offering TARPG skill groups. A Qualtrics survey was used to assess participants' perceived gains from involvement. It was hypothesized that youth and young adult participants in a six-week TARPG group would report high satisfaction means in domains of confidence, self-esteem, self-expression, quality of life, empathy, feelings of support, and ability to talk and connect with peers. Results from the study indicate average perceived benefits between the two highest (1-2) answer options occurred in all domains except quality of life and self-expression, with these categories still demonstrating positive outcomes. Notably, benefits were still more pronounced in these domains among LGBQ+ and gender nonconforming participants. Qualitative feedback from participants helped to support the rationale for these benefits and provided insight for areas of further improvement.","2023-08-01","2023-08-10 19:22:08","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","90","","","","","","","","","","California State University, San Bernardino","San Bernardino","en","","Master of Science in Clinical/Counseling Psychology","","","","","","","","","_therapy; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though art has been recognized as therapeutic both in the psychological and cultural realms for generations, it is now essential to infuse dramatic storytelling practices into the pedagogies and curricula of our grade school classrooms.The isolation created by pandemic shutdowns &amp; social distancing, sociocultural &amp; political warfare in the U.S., and social media addictions, leaves us with less and less time to connect on a basic human emotional level. Dramatic storytelling provides an opportunity to build community, self-reflect, and find growth and healing.During an eight-week period, I executed a dramatic storytelling workshop through the ArtsBridge America fellowship program at UC Santa Cruz, which connected me with a local, underfunded public school. Through documentation of the lesson plans, reflections on the classes, and analysis of the students' experiences, I argue for implementing dramatic storytelling as a necessary and invaluable power.","2023","2023-08-10 19:25:20","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-08-10 19:25:20","","","","","","","The Therapeutic Power of Theater","","","","","UC Santa Cruz","","en","","","","","escholarship.org","","","","","","_therapy; _theater; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous work predicts that the English simple present is incompatible with eventives outside of limited semantic contexts (e.g. habituals) (Langacker 2001). I ask whether there is variation between tenses and aspects in TTRPG narration and how it may pattern. I also ask which semantic variety of the simple present is found in TTRPGs, using bicontextual semantics (Anand & Toosarvandani 2019) to determine whether it is consistent with the limited previously theorized varieties, and whether and how those theories should be refined to account for this data. By building and analyzing a corpus of TTRPG gameplay transcripts, I find that the simple present is the dominant tense-aspect morphology used with eventive verbs in the corpus, and that third person singular present verbs appear in narrative contexts at a higher rate than other verb types do. I also find that all criteria are met for the TTRPG simple present to be considered a performative — with the modification that these new performatives can have non-first-person features as long as the utterer has agency over the actions of the subject of the utterance. These findings broaden the possible analyses of English tense and aspect semantics by drawing from underutilized data, and also provide linguistic evidence to support anthropological and literary conclusions drawn in previous work in game studies (Mackay 2001, Kawitsky 2020, i.a.) about the performative and agentive properties of TTRPGs.","2023-08-01","2023-08-10 19:29:03","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-08-10 19:27:33","","","","","","","Performing Performatives","","","","","Princeton University","","en","","BA","","","dataspace.princeton.edu","","Accepted: 2023-08-01T16:23:13Z","","","","_language learning; _narrative authority; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 20th century, one of the most influential works, if not the most influential, is J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogy. With The Hobbit, Tolkien introduced readers to a vision of a fantasy world that continues to influence the genre today. Dungeons & Dragons, a table-top role-playing game published by Tactical Studies Rules in 1973, primarily under the guidance of Gary Gygax, derives many of its features from works that were popular when Gygax was growing up such as The Hobbit, as well as pulp fictions such as Conan the Conqueror by Robert E. Howard. With the origins of D&D being so explicitly rooted in notable works of modern fantasy, D&D provides a revealing interpretation of the genre. Indeed, although not a conventional literary text, D&D now arguably has a central place in the development of the genre.  By studying the history and construction of the game, and the various controversies over its development and tropes, we can discover both the depth of influence it has had, both on the conventions and the public perception of the fantasy genre more broadly.","2023","2023-08-22 19:15:14","2024-02-09 15:48:23","2023-08-22 19:13:57","","","","","","","Dungeons and Dragons","","","","","University of Oregon","","en","CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","BA Honor","","","scholarsbank.uoregon.edu","","Accepted: 2023-08-18T15:58:46Z Publisher: University of Oregon","","","","_moral panic; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The DM must digest information about the game setting and monsters, synthesize scenes to present to other players, and respond to the players' interactions with the scene. Doing all of these tasks while maintaining consistency within the narrative and story world is no small feat of human cognition, making the task tiring and unapproachable to new players. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT have shown remarkable abilities to generate coherent natural language text. In this paper, we conduct a formative evaluation with DMs to establish the use cases of LLMs in D&D and tabletop gaming generally. We introduce CALYPSO, a system of LLM-powered interfaces that support DMs with information and inspiration specific to their own scenario. CALYPSO distills game context into bite-sized prose and helps brainstorm ideas without distracting the DM from the game. When given access to CALYPSO, DMs reported that it generated high-fidelity text suitable for direct presentation to players, and low-fidelity ideas that the DM could develop further while maintaining their creative agency. We see CALYPSO as exemplifying a paradigm of AI-augmented tools that provide synchronous creative assistance within established game worlds, and tabletop gaming more broadly.","2023-08-14","2023-08-22 19:28:00","2023-08-31 01:05:48","2023-08-22 19:27:53","","","","","","","CALYPSO","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2308.07540 [cs]","","","","_advice; _GMing; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _ai ml llm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:2308.07540","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate hands-on SE awareness training as one component of broader SE awareness campaigns, we created a SE tabletop game called Tabletop As Social Engineering Prevention (TASEP) in two editions for (a) small and medium enterprises and (b) large corporations, respectively. Its game design is inspired by Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games and facilitates LEGO models of the in-game target organizations.

First released in 1974, D&D remains the most popular and globally successful RPG franchise. Although developed as a tabletop game where players sit at a table, rolling dice and sketching maps on paper, the game is is no longer a necessarily non-digital experience. Rather,“the modern play and consumption of D&D [is] more hybrid than initially accounted for”(Sidhu and Carter 2020, 11). Echoing other forms of hybrid tabletop play (Rogerson et al. 2021), D&D players increasingly use digital tools to deliver in-game effects, character management tools, and communication opportunities. Key to the experience of an RPG is the customized character that each player creates as their interface to the game world. Character creation, however, is a complex process that presents barriers for new players (Rients 2014, 11-13, Gibson 2020, 69). D&D characters are traditionally generated manually by players, who roll dice to determine values for attributes such as Intelligence, Strength and Wisdom. These attributes influence and constrain the player’s experiences within the game. With multiple steps in the character creation process and dependencies between aspects of the created character, this necessary precursor to play can seem more chore than play.","2021","2023-08-27 08:37:06","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","1–2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What ramifications do these role-playing games have for the individuals and groups that play them? What possibilities do they contain for human liberation? This thesis attempts to answer these questions through a combination of historical and philosophical inquiry. I ground this thesis in recent historical scholarship on the origin and development of role-playing games, namely the work on Dungeons & Dragons by Jon Peterson. I combine this historical scholarship with the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bernard Suits, and C. Thi Nguyen to establish a theoretical philosophical grounding with which to understand the nature of role-playing and of games in general. These two disciplines of scholarship, along with some sociological and anthropological work, inform my approach to the topic of role-playing games and liberation. I analyze these games with respect to three issues: individual agency, narrative storytelling and community formation, and the culture industry. I argue for the liberatory potential of role-playing games on all three counts. These games enhance a sense of agential fluidity which allows players to better understand themselves and each another, helping to liberate people from narrow-mindedness with regard to identity. The narrative storytelling and consequent community formation within these games establishes a space where people can interact with others in a non-capitalized manner, and some (but not all) of these games can allow for a process of resisting the influence of capital and the culture industry though a direct imagining of alternatives to capitalism. I argue role-playing games can aid in a process of depicting ways to liberate humanity from capitalist domination, both through their structural features of agency and community formation and through the act of directly depicting social alternatives to the world of capitalism.","2023-01-01","2023-08-31 00:56:51","2023-08-31 01:05:48","","","","","","","","Seeds of Liberation or Spheres of Domination","","","","","The College of Wooster","","en","","BA Senior Independent Study Theses","","","","","","","","","_politics; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _theoretical work; _SOCIOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Descriptions of autistic play have typically focused on “deficits” and are based on comparisons to neurotypical “norms”. According to the neurodiversity paradigm, it is important that autistic voices are highlighted and that difficulties, differences, and strengths are explored. With this in mind, we designed the present study to focus on the experiences and perspectives of autistic people concerning the topic of autistic play. Methods: We conducted a consultation with autistic stakeholders, as well as with parents and teachers of autistic individuals to help us design the study and interview questions. We used semi-structured interviews with 22 autistic adults aged 18–57 years (clinically confirmed diagnosis, n = 21; self-diagnosed, n = 1) who live in the United Kingdom. We analyzed the data using interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify themes. Results: We found important commonalities and differences in the ways that socialization in play, imaginary play, and flow (a state involving intense focus on the play) are experienced. Autistic adults discussed the importance of both solitary play and social play, with solitary play having an important recuperative function. They also reported preferences for parallel play and playing with similar autistic people. They also discussed imaginary play experiences, including social role-play and grounded-in-reality play, and the dual nature of flow experiences during play. Conclusions: The findings of this study contrast with deficit-focused understandings of autistic play and build on neurodiversity-informed studies. We highlight, for example, the importance of considering the different circumstances under which solitary play or social play are preferred, as well as the importance of taking an individual approach to play. We encourage wider understanding and acceptance of these play preferences and experiences to support autistic people's well-being. Community brief Why is this an important issue? Usually, descriptions of autistic play are negative and are based on what non-autistic people think autistic play should be like. We think that it is important to challenge this by exploring autistic play in a more balanced way and focusing on what autistic people say about their play. What was the purpose of this study? We wanted to find out how autistic adults experience play. We were also interested in how they think their play is different from non-autistic play. What did the researchers do? We asked autistic and non-autistic people to help us design our study and interview questions. We interviewed 22 autistic adults and asked them about their play now or when they were younger. We then analyzed the data using a qualitative method called interpretative phenomenological analysis. This meant that we could identify themes covering the group's views and experiences. What were the results of the study? We found a range of play experiences and different ways in which some autistic adults play. Many autistic adults talked about the importance of both playing by themselves and with others, with solitary play described as being recuperating. Some described preferring play that involves playing nearby other people without necessarily interacting with them directly. Many preferred to play with similar autistic people. Several autistic adults discussed engaging in imaginary play activities such as role-play and preferring play that is based on reality. They also described the benefits and limitations of something called a flow state, which involves intense focus on the play. What do these findings add to what was already known? Our findings highlight how autistic adults like to play and different ways some autistic adults experience play. For example, we highlight the situations where solitary play and social play are preferred, and the importance of understanding that different people like to play in different ways. What are potential weaknesses in the study? We did not involve autistic people beyond consultation. We think that a better understanding of autistic play can come from using approaches with greater autistic involvement, such as co-production. Most of our participants were White, highly educated, and primarily communicate using speech. We do not know if other autistic people would experience play in a similar way. How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future? Understanding and acceptance of the ways in which autistic people like to play can help support autistic people's well-being. In practice, this involves limiting the use of supports that aim to make autistic people's play “normal” and instead encouraging authentic autistic play.","2023-08-28","2023-08-31 00:59:45","2023-09-18 14:11:51","2023-08-31 00:59:39","","","0","0","","Autism in Adulthood","Diversity in Autistic Play","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","_autism; _playfulness; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _PSYCHOLOGY; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also under examination was the impact that virtual role-play had on these queer rhetorical and communication practices. I asked three research questions within this dissertation: How is queerness communicated and performed in virtual Dungeons & Dragons games? How do queer folks use or alter the space of virtual Dungeons & Dragons games? How do queer folks co-construct community and belonging in virtual Dungeons & Dragons games? To address these questions, I conducted 17 semi-structured interviews with participants who identified as queer and/or LGBTQIA+ and had experience playing virtual Dungeons & Dragons games. I used thematic analysis and theoretical concepts from queer theory and Gloria Anzaldúa to analyze the interview data. Through this analysis, I identified several themes for each research question. This study found that participants communicate queerness by subverting the normative, viewing queerness as the default, and showing agency. Participants perform queerness through embodied metaphors and by trialing aspects of identity. Participants in this study use virtual space to gain access to other queer folks, to provide safety, and to seize opportunities for queer community engagement and representation. To co-construct community and belonging, queer folks use queer worldbuilding, maintain a patient and invitational attitude, and support systemic change within the tabletop role-playing game system. The Anzaldúan concepts of Borderlands, hacienda caras, nepantla, nepantleras, and la facultad were useful in the interpretation of the findings.","2023","2023-09-05 17:13:04","2023-11-28 17:59:57","2023-09-05 17:11:52","","124","","","","","Cultivating Community and Belonging","","","","","Iowa State University","Ames","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798380157803","","","","_lgbtq; _TTRPG; _belonging; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","Community; Digital rhetoric; Queer rhetoric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research Methods In 2021, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted focus group discussions (3 groups, 14 participants, aged 24–55) and an online survey (354 participants, aged 18–63) with current D&D players to better understand what play experiences were meaningful and appealing for them—in consideration of the game’s contemporary resurgence. Key Finding and Discussion Our qualitative analysis focuses on participant responses that described the presence and appeal of transgressive play that knowingly challenges player boundaries or game boundaries, what we term benevolent transgression.

I argue that even though D&D players were opening the same books and working within the same rule sets, the stories they created, and the experiences born of those stories, are unique and entirely their own. While widespread social and cultural factors—the wave of negative press from the Satanic Panic and common beliefs on gender dynamics, for instance—may have influenced how people engaged with the game and other players, factors like location, familial religious affiliations, and the general attitudes of parents and friends, also played a role in shaping player decisions and interactions. From a series of fourteen oral histories I conducted in the fall of 2022, I extracted three main themes across conversations: identity, community, and culture. Identity, chapter two, explores small group dynamics and roleplaying, specifically how players used the game as a space for performing identity and what identities people brought to the table. The third chapter, Community, investigates how individuals chose to interact with the larger circle of D&D players though opportunities like gaming clubs and conventions. Finally, the fourth chapter, Culture, examines the ways that player’s experiences were shaped by perceptions of the game resulting from pervasive stereotypes or Satanic Panic fears present in mainstream American culture. This study reifies the connections between individual voices and the D&D subculture; that subculture and the mainstream culture; and the relationship between the individual player and the culture at large. For D&D players, the game was, and remains, a tool for self-reflection, an outlet for creative expression, and a tether to a supportive community.","2023-01-01","2023-09-05 17:22:39","2023-09-26 15:31:10","","","","","","","","More Than Stories","","","","","The College of Wooster","","en","","BA Senior Independent Study Theses","","","","","","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lawlor (Philos Phenomenol Res 79(1):47–75, 2009) and Cassam (Vices of the mind: from the intellectual to the political. OUP, Oxford, 2014) develop inferential accounts of self-knowledge in which one can use imagination to acquire self-knowledge. This is done by actively prompting imaginary scenarios and observing one’s reactions to those scenarios. These reactions are then used as the inferential basis for acquiring self-knowledge. I suggest that the imaginary scenarios can be in principle replaced with scenarios in virtual reality in a way that still provides an inferential basis for self-knowledge. Instead of internal prompting in imagination, I call this external prompting in virtual reality. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of external prompting. On one hand, external prompting avoids some of the common biases that can intervene with internal prompting in imagination. On the other hand, external prompting comes with some challenges of its own. External prompting might be more time-consuming and might be open to a game-like approach of the agent leading to a different sort of distortion that gets in the way of self-knowledge. I suggest that these are practical challenges, but nevertheless, external prompting seems worthwhile for self-knowledge that is otherwise especially difficult to acquire.","2023-09-02","2023-09-05 21:00:16","2023-09-26 15:07:12","2023-09-05 20:59:04","87","","3","202","","Synthese","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","_immersion; _moral play; _peer reviewed; _self-reflection; =cleaned; _theoretical work; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg","Virtual reality; Introspection; Self-belief; Self-knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this design case study paper, we describe the design of a 10-day unit on Native American history implemented across nine teachers’ elementary school classrooms in the US.

In 2024, the enormously influential tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons—also known as D&D—celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. To mark the occasion, editors Premeet Sidhu, Marcus Carter, and José Zagal have assembled an edited collection that celebrates and reflects on important parts of the game's past, present, and future. Each chapter in Fifty Years of Dungeons & Dragons explores why the nondigital game is more popular than ever—with sales increasing 33 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite worldwide lockdowns—and offers readers the opportunity to critically reflect on their own experiences, perceptions, and play of D&D. Fifty Years of Dungeons & Dragons draws on fascinating research and insight from expert scholars in the field, including: Gary Alan Fine, whose 1983 book Shared Fantasy remains a canonical text in game studies; Jon Peterson, celebrated D&D historian; Daniel Justice, Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Literature and Expressive Culture; and numerous leading and emerging scholars from the growing discipline of game studies, including Amanda Cote, Esther MacCallum-Stewart, and Aaron Trammell. The chapters cover a diverse range of topics—from D&D's adoption in local contexts and classrooms and by queer communities to speculative interpretations of what D&D might look like in one hundred years—that aim to deepen readers' understanding of the game.","2024","2023-09-15 16:45:37","2023-09-15 16:46:03","","","336","","","","","","","","","","The MIT Press","Cambridge, Massachusetts","en","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","GV1469.62.D84","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; _HISTORYOFRPG","Social aspects; History","Sidhu, Premeet; Carter, Marcus; Zagal, José Pablo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cyborg is positioned as a theory by Donna J. Haraway to explore the expansive opportunities to surpass gender binaries by embracing technological adaptation to human forms. I push this concept further to determine how gender is perceived and performed in imagined sci-fi futures. My research focuses on the practice of embracing cyborgian technology through interactive play in role-playing games within the science fiction subgenre, cyberpunk. In examining the works, Cyberpunk Red (a table-top role-playing game) and Cyberpunk 2077 (a role-playing video game), I interrogate the potential for the cyborg to be queered through collaborative and interactive play. By delving into the history and structure of role-playing games along with the themes of the cyberpunk genre, I reflect on the queer potential that this media provides to players and audiences.","2023","2023-09-15 18:41:13","2023-09-26 15:31:10","2023-09-15 18:20:58","","118","","","","","","","","","","University of North Carolina at Greensboro","Greensboro","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.A.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798380172684","","","","_lgbtq; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _computer rpg; _GAMEPLAY","Queer; Cyberpunk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From a combined game studies and heritage studies perspective, role-playing games (RPGs) have a unique advantage in that they immerse the player in a character to experience and understand the basics of culture in an engaging way. Among different types of role-playing games, live-action role-playing (larp) and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) have a great potential to promote the learning of intangible cultural expressions and traditions that make them available to a wider public. In China, MMORPGs have had a positive impact on preserving China’s intangible heritage in virtual space and larps, specifically in the form of Jubensha, are also playing an important role in the same way. The purpose of this study is to delve into how the ICH of China is being represented in MMORPGs and larps as an educational tool. With that target in mind, a close reading of selected MMORPG games -- A Dream of Jianghu and Justice Online -- and a larp game -- The Secret of the Gauze Lantern -- was conducted. The goals of this research are to understand what cultural experiences are integrated in those role-playing games to introduce Chinese ICH and explore the main differences between them in representing those intangible cultural elements. After analyzing these RPGs in-depth, I argue that both MMORPGs and larps show potential to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage of China; while MMORPGs present national-level intangible elements from different regions of China, Jubensha as a kind of larp focuses more on the indigenous traditions and customs of small-scale local areas.","2023-09-19","2023-09-19 15:37:42","2023-11-16 14:53:38","2023-09-19 15:36:38","41-46","","14","","","","Experiencing China’s Intangible Cultural Heritage in Role-playing Games","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Yuqiao Liu","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 14","","","","_history; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _LARP; _computer rpg; _asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our question as artists and larpwrights was how those objects might affect the act of thinking itself. From this initial thought, we developed the notion of Living Objects — elements created to cause people to have strange new ideas and awaken thoughts beyond those prompted by reason alone — and sought to employ them in the micro role-playing games we presented to people in Rio de Janeiro in order to stimulate such an exploration of fantasy, desire, and daydreaming. The theoretical underpinning of our work relies upon the recovery of wonder discussed by critics like Kareem, Brain, and others. Within this endeavor, we presented Living Objects as fragments that provide a joke (witz). Witz is a concept explored by the Jena Romantic philosophers, in which poetic fragments of words influence thought or cause strangeness in normal ways of thinking, and cause derangement in the current logic. With this, they enable new creative paths for imagination. In doing so, we drew upon the cultural heritage of the city of Rio de Janeiro, especially the art of Bispo do Rosário, who produced a number of distinctive artistic objects during the decades that he was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. And in this work, we focus especially on a piece called “The Presentation Cloak.” These objects are central elements of micro role-playing games that we createdto encourage people to experience the stories linked to the life of Bispo do Rosário and the spaces he imagined about Rio de Janeiro. These games also inspired the participants to create stories from these objects, realizing how the influence of these elements stimulates imagination, belief in wonder, and immersion in the cultural universe created by Bispo do Rosário.","2023-09-19","2023-09-19 15:37:42","2023-11-16 14:53:30","2023-09-19 15:36:38","31-40","","14","","","","Playing with Wonders","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Rian Rezende, Denise Portinari","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 14","","","","_history; _layout; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _brazil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The game combines elements of role-playing, a board game, and cards to present the complexity of the situation in the Emergency State Zone on the Polish-Belarusian border, especially on the practical, social, and institutional levels. The purpose of the tool is to raise the participants’ awareness of the current situation and to enhance an active search for solutions to the crisis. The game enables participants to adopt a perspective of a border zone resident or a refugee, and ultimately modify the rules governing the world to make it fairer. Providing the participants with agency to reconstruct the game environment during the debriefing made it possible to generate numerous possible solutions at the level of direct interventions; e.g., providing shelters in forests, training residents in first aid; legal, e.g., access by doctors and media, allowing humanitarian organizations; and executive, e.g., more effective enforcement of European law. Also, the exposure to goals inconsistent with personal views under significant immersion evokes various strategies to deal with the clash, including passive agreement, rationalization, gentle disagreement, and extreme disagreement. Such a game can inspire a positive change in the level of participants’ understanding, interesting solutions, activist attitudes, and empathy towards asylum seekers. However, the game can also expose the dangerous, existing mechanisms that pose a challenge to society, and what should be monitored and possibly mitigated in the future.","2023-09-19","2023-09-19 15:37:42","2023-11-16 14:52:47","2023-09-19 15:36:38","9-21","","14","","","","The People","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Weronika Szatkowska","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 14","","","","_immersion; _agency; _attitude change; _simulation; _leadership; _megagame; _negotiation; _politics; _refugee; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The intention of this text is to reflect on larp using the concept of anthropophagy: a cultural metaphor created by Oswald de Andrade, one of the members of the Art Week. Anthropophagy is characterized by the de-hierarchization of the hegemonic places of culture and by the critical digestion of the Other. Andrade’s reflections crossed time: they influenced literature, theater, painting, cinema and music, to name a few. Applied to larps, the concept of anthropophagy is discussed from the point of view of the communicology of Vilém Flusser, who was also influenced by Andrade’s thought. Finally, this essay seeks to reveal larp’s resonance with the Theatre of the Oppressed, proposed by Augusto Boal – also one of those influenced by anthropophagic thinking. With this resonance, I seek to highlight the transformative potential of anthropophagy, here considered inherent to larps, interpreting one Brazilian larp as a case study. Although this essay does not commit the naivety of treating larp as a panacea, its ultimate intention is to highlight the dialogical and social character of larps, as well as their potential to challenge power structures.","2023-09-19","2023-09-19 15:37:42","2023-11-16 14:53:11","2023-09-19 15:36:38","22-30","","14","","","","Towards the Post-Modern Art Week","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Tadeu Rodrigues Iuama","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 14","","","","_fandom; _anthropology; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP; _brazil; _SOCIOLOGY; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Self-recording of our lives, communities, and culture has occurred almost exclusively through non-formal means. Queer heritage has seen recent scholarly study of these non-formal means in the form of archives of oral histories, ephemera, and ethnographies. This work emphasises the critical role safer community, social, and performance spaces play in containing, creating, and disseminating queer histories and heritage. Despite this increased visibility, the need for more grassroots expressions of nonnormative genders and sexualities remains crucial for queer people to find support. As part of my wider work exploring the potential live action role-playing games (larps) might have for the exploration of gender subjectivity through play, in this paper I suggest that larps can also provide a space to document, disseminate, and educate on queer experience, history, and culture. Larp is a democratic form of expression that does not require performance skill or training, but rather allows people to experience empowerment, including for those who come from marginalized backgrounds, i.e., through emancipatory bleed (Kemper 2020; Baird 2021; Cazeneuve 2021). Larp has on occasion been used for non-formal education on queer history, such as in the larp Just a Little Lovin’ (2011) about the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, which includes educational workshops and debriefs on notable historical and cultural themes (Groth, Grasmo, and Edland 2022). Larp used this way is not dissimilar to the way queer social and performance space has been co-created as a container for both meaning-making and heritage for LGBTQIA+ people. On this basis, I argue that game design that seeks to reflect and represent this kind of queer cultural production in social and performance spaces may allow for the non-formal education on LGBTQIA+ lives and heritage, as well as opportunities for personal (gender) expression, exploration, and embodiment.","2023-09-19","2023-09-19 15:37:42","2023-11-16 14:53:23","2023-09-19 15:36:38","71-81","","14","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Josephine Baird","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 14","","","","_bleed; _history; _gender; _lgbtq; _peer reviewed; _sex-transgressive; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This connection may serve as a catalyst for an ongoing bond that might foster personal growth as well as present-day community building. There are many reports on the impact that the larp has had on the participants on a personal level (Baird 2021; Bowman 2015; Friedner 2022; Gronemann ed. 2013; Groth et al. 2021; Levin 2019, Stenros 2021; Stenros and Sihvonen 2019). Through the lens of emerging theories on transformational role-playing, new perspectives arise that enlighten these experiences further. Taking into consideration metareflection (Levin 2020), transformational containers (Baird 2021; Bowman and Hugaas 2021), and different types of bleed (Bowman and Hugaas 2021; Kemper 2020), this article discusses what we might learn from role-playing queer history. I argue that in the affirmative space of the larp, playing queer personality traits that might have been suppressed has offered personal growth through emotional (Bowman and Hugaas 2021), emancipatory (Kemper 2020), and ego bleed (Beltrán 2012). However, continued development of marginalized personality traits might require extended integration work, for which post larp practices are just emerging. Through the feeling of belonging to historical queer movements that JaLL offers, participants have been spurred to reach out to queer communities of the present-day, and have also built their own queer communities, both of which may support prolonged integration and development processes. These perspectives might aid in a continued development on post-larp integration practices and community building, as well as open up the possibility for other marginalized groups and historical movements to consider how they might benefit from their own bespoke larps.","2023-09-19","2023-09-19 15:37:42","2023-11-16 14:53:50","2023-09-19 15:36:39","82-90","","14","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Hilda Levin","","","","journals.uu.se","","Number: 14","","","","_embodiment; _lgbtq; _peer reviewed; =cleaned; _LARP","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In her book Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Video Games, Consalvo (2007) presented the term gaming capital to give a name and meaning to the collective understanding of both the individual player and the communities that entail the discussions about the game, genre, or the platform – including topics like knowledge, experience, and skill. Yet, there has not been much scholarly attention given to where one would situate gaming capital between cultural and symbolic capital, and where social capital would influence the transformation of knowledge to gaming capital. The discussion about gaming capital has been more about what it is, and what can be or cannot be gaming capital, but what steers gaming capital as an entity at their disposal has not been studied enough yet. The world of gaming has moved massively forwards in fifteen years, and the whole concept of what “gaming” is has subsequently changed, not only within the online multiplayer video game scene, but within analogue role-playing games too. Both mediums have their ways of accumulating and spending capital, and not everything is different in terms of gaming capital. Therefore, this study approaches the formation of gaming capital within both Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) and Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974) through information flow and social space perspectives.","2023-09-19","2023-09-19 15:37:42","2024-01-13 17:05:12","2023-09-19 15:36:39","91-98","","14","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Henry Korkeila, J.

However, existing programs struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving crises and uncertainties that contribute to deforestation and forest degradation. To tackle these challenges, integrating innovative approaches into forest education is essential. This paper showcases the transformative use of a strategy game, MineSet, as an innovative teaching method for integrated forest management. The game facilitates deeply engaging experiences that provide unique insights into complex issues like deforestation. By assuming various stakeholder roles, graduate students actively engage with and confront the intricate tradeoffs inherent in forest management. This interactive and immersive role-play game not only fosters critical thinking skills but also promotes collaborative problem-solving, making MineSet a highly innovative and attractive tool in forest education. The importance of extended debriefings, facilitation throughout the game, and ongoing discussions should not be underestimated, as they establish meaningful and necessary connections between in-game events, validated educational material, and published research outcomes. Moreover, the game equips students with practical experience and a comprehensive understanding of landscape approaches, using the Congo Basin as a case study. We emphasize the potential of innovative forest education to foster sustainability, stimulate critical thinking, resolve conflicts, and prevent costly forest losses.","2023-08","2023-09-20 13:32:50","2023-11-16 17:07:47","2023-09-20 13:32:35","1646","","8","14","","","Fostering Innovation, Transition, and the Reconstruction of Forestry","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 8 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","_ecology; _negotiation; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _transformative; =0.33; =cleaned; =MF; _LEARNING","innovations in teaching; MineSet; social innovation; sustainable forest landscape governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is worthwhile to explore play, specifically Table-Top Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs), as a method to combat and cope with mental health decline. Research shows that there is a relationship between playing TTRPGs, the development of skills, and improved well-being. There is little research to validate or measure the benefits of playing TTRPGs recreationally or therapeutically in adult populations. This study aimed to contribute to existing research by exploring the association between mental health and TTRPGs by examining mental health status between adults who engage in TTRPGs and adults who don’t. This study also examined whether recalling TTRPG activities was associated with higher mental health status scores and explored if there is a correlation between time spent playing TTRPGs and mental health. A Qualtrics survey was developed and distributed to obtain demographic data and to assess mental health status using the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form between two different groups before and after an autobiographical recall procedure. Analyses were conducted using independent and paired samples t-tests and correlation analysis. Analyses showed a difference in social and emotional well-being between the groups. Findings also indicated that mental health status scores significantly improved after the TTRPG group completed the recall procedure. Finally, a weak positive correlation was discovered between time spent playing TTRPGs and mental health status.","2023","2023-09-20 13:46:16","2023-11-28 18:00:02","2023-09-20 13:34:22","","63","","","","","Roll Perception","","","","","Tennessee State University","","en","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","M.S.

As a consequence of this, scholars are directing their attention to how literature lives on beyond the book. While much of this research focuses on forms of intermediality, less attention has been given to embodied, participatory and interactive practices where literature is used in a variety of ways. In this chapter, we will discuss what happens to literature when it is used in physical, collaborative gameplay, focusing on live action role playing (larp), specifically larps in the Nordic tradition.                      Since larp is located at the intersection of a number of different cultural expressions, we draw on scholarly work on gaming, performance, adaptation and participatory culture to discuss how literary material is used in three different larps, at which we have carried out fieldwork. Fortune and Felicity (2017) engaged with all of Jane Austen’s work, taking place over five days in period costume and setting. Located at the actual Elsinore Castle, Inside Hamlet (2017) adapted Shakespeare’s play to a revolutionary, decadent context. Using Thomas Vinterberg’s film The Celebration as the frame story, A Nice Evening With the Family (2018) thematised bourgeois family trauma through the use of a number of nineteenth-century Scandinavian plays, like Henrik Ibsen’s A Doll’s House.                      Although thematically diverse, these larps raise common questions: What happens when a literary storyworld is materialised in embodied practices such as live action role playing? How can the unfolding story be understood collectively and individually and what storytelling mechanisms are used? What does it feel like to embody characters and actions from a work of fiction? By addressing these questions, this chapter highlights the intricate relation between literature and its collective embodiment in larp.","2023","2023-09-20 13:50:08","2024-01-13 17:01:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","DOI:10.4324/9781003119739","","","","_literature; _adaptation; _nordic larp; =cleaned; _LARP","","Ensslin, Astrid; Round, Julia; Thomas, Bronwen","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In spite of the costs, labelling and categorizing entities are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic evaluation. Even though annotation can be done by non-experts in most cases, due to the fact that this requires human labour, the process is costly. Another major challenge encountered in data annotation is maintaining annotation consistency. Annotation efforts are typically carried out by teams of multiple annotators. The annotations need to maintain consistency in relation to both the domain truth and annotation format while reducing human errors. Annotating a specialized domain that deviates significantly from the general domain, such as fantasy literature, will see a significant amount of human error and annotator disagreement. So it is vital that proper guidelines and error reduction mechanisms are enforced. One way to enforce these constraints is by using a specialized application. Such an app can ensure that the notations are consistent, and the labels can be pre-defined or restricted reducing the room for errors. In this paper, we present SHADE, an annotation software that can be used to annotate entities in the high fantasy literature domain Dungeons and Dragons extracted from the Forgotten Realms Fandom Wiki.","2023-08","2023-09-26 13:52:24","2024-01-13 15:55:04","2023-09-26 13:48:00","1-6","","","","","","SHADE","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2164-7011","","","","_dnd; _data; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _ai ml llm; _text mining/text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE 17th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems (ICIIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their creative appropriations of digital technologies and physical tools to allow for hybrid distanced play demonstrate not only the resilience of boardgaming as a hobby, but also provide important insights into the design of novel distanced hybrid digital boardgames (DHDBs). Through a survey of over 1300 respondents, this paper explores the ways distanced players engaged in homebrew practices to make physical boardgame play possible. Through reflexive thematic analysis, we identify three themes that reflect the practical issues players grappled with, including game choice, game mode or setup, and technical implementation. Reflecting on the challenges and opportunities associated with these issues, we consider their implications for DHDB design more generally. In doing so, we present the DHYE (Distanced Hybrid plaY Experience) framework, a practical set of design considerations that emphasises an understanding of distance not simply as an obstacle to enjoyable boardgame play but as an inspiration for novel and meaningful design.","2023-10-04","2023-10-13 15:15:22","2023-11-16 17:02:24","2023-10-13 15:14:59","376:45–376:72","","","7","","","Lessons from Homebrewed Hybridity","","","","","","","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","","","_boardgame; _remote; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _covid19; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _GAMEPLAY","game design; COVID-19; remote play; boardgames; distanced play; hybrid play; pandemic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From sex-swap curses in Gygax's “Tomb of Horrors” (1978) to the shapechanging “blessed elves of Corellon” (2017), D&D's approach to fantasy realism mechanically and narratively excludes trans bodies, vilifies trans stories, and diminishes trans power.

The cost of game materials such as rule books, dice, and miniatures (or ""minis"") can prevent some people from playing. This presentation gives an overview of open resources and low-cost/no-cost materials that librarians, educators, community event planners and others can use to eliminate barriers and welcome all gamers to the table. We will describe how Wizards of the Coast’s open gaming license and System Reference Document, virtual tabletop systems, and other resources can eliminate or minimize the cost required to build custom, or ""homebrew,"" campaigns.

Research in this topic could provide a deeper insight into how a shared hobby can help large groups organize meaningful action in response to perceived threats to their ways of life. In the wake of the January 2023 Open Gaming Licence (OGL) Leak, hobby game company Wizards of the Coast, publishers for Dungeons and Dragons, has seen unprecedented drops in sales and customer retention. This report uses thematic analysis to find common patterns and themes present in the reporting of the OGL leak from both traditional media outlets, as well as creators on TikTok. Using the themes found in these sources, the sentiments of the respective comment sections has been recorded to find what effect the actions of Wizards of the Coast during this crisis has had on their brand and the impact it may have on the TTRPG community. The research concluded that many customers within the Dungeons and Dragons community had already harboured negative views of Wizards of the Coast regarding previous business practices and found the leaked OGL was the straw that broke the camels back. This sentiment led to a substantial portion of the Dungeons and Dragons community cancelling subscriptions to D&amp;D Beyond, a service provided by Wizards of the Coast, and moving their buying power to other competitors within the TTRPG community. This has begun a shift towards the dethroning of Wizards of the Coast and Dungeons and Dragons as the top of an RPG monolith and a renaissance of independently published TTRPGs.","2023-10-13","2023-10-18 14:19:44","2023-11-16 15:04:52","2023-10-18 14:18:39","","","2","1","","","Dungeons and Dragons and the Critical Failure","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Luke  Pye","","","","cdm.ucalgary.ca","","Number: 2","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _copyright; _publishing; _diy; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA; _HISTORYOFRPG","Audience Perception; Audience Reception; OGL; Open Gaming License; UGC; User-Generated Content; Wizards of the Coast","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lewis, Charles Williams, and Mythopoeic Literature","","0146-9339","","https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol42/iss1/8","This essay introduces the concept of negative estrangement to help understand current cultural interventions into the norms of depicting fantasy races. First, this essay builds on Shklovsky’s concept of estrangement to describe the literary practice of negative estrangement, wherein artists craft “more evil” foes based on hybridized amalgamations of stereotypes to create antipathy toward a subject, be it monster or fantasy race. This practice is sometimes used in service of confronting the issue of race and racism, despite seeming to reify or rearticulate racist stereotypes. This essay builds on Tolkien’s argument in favor of creating “more evil” foes to exemplify heroic action from Tolkien’s essay “Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics” as part of the structure of negative estrangement. It also builds on the sense of how, as Helen Young describes, fantasy can seem safer for the cultural work of exploring issues of race due to its apparent rhetorical distance from the real world. In allowing the non-realistic reification of fantasy races, the issue of racism can be addressed substantively without audience rejection. The work of R. A. Salvatore is productive as a case study to understand this literary practice. R. A. Salvatore has written over 30 novels focusing on the dark elf, “drow,” character of Drizzt Do’Urden. In his writing, Salvatore demonstrates a fundamental paradox between the desire of artists to craft anti-racist narratives and the need to depict “evil” fantasy races in mass market action fantasy prose. Since 2020, the Wizards of the Coast game Dungeons & Dragons has been in the process of active revision and rewriting its handling of fantasy races. Part of the purpose of this essay is to highlight the ways that the fantasy genre is continuing change its handling of the depiction or conception of fantasy races.","2023-10-20","2023-10-26 21:20:03","2023-11-16 15:04:52","","121-146","","1","42","","","Negative Estrangement","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_literature; _philosophy; _minority; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using this virtual tabletop as an incentive, we invited 11 TTRPG players to offer their views and perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of VR to support gameplay.

As technical communication researchers, we were fascinated by the online discussion around this event as news spread across various D&D communities on the social media platform Reddit and even spilled out into broader roleplaying, gaming, and legal subreddits. Fans needed to reorient and resituate themselves across communities as developments unfolded, especially as moderators and prominent users strategically influenced the discourse within these subreddits. As both active members of these subreddits and researchers, we believe this case has much to teach the field of technical communication, particularly in the way it illustrates the need for tactical research methods when engaging with the shifting boundaries of social media research spaces. Researchers must also be savvy towards the limits of a platform, as well as their own positionality and their relationships to online communities when reporting on events.

In our analysis we focus on how non-binary gender is represented, and ways in which the comics reveal implicit anxieties around non/human characters who are non-binary. The idea that non-binary gender is ‘hiding’ a true, binary, gender is present within and beyond the text: rather than accepting these characters’ non-binary gender as a fact of their species within the narrative, it is treated a puzzle to be solved. We explore how texts, and fans, focus upon the body and subsequently sexuality as a locus of gender ‘truth’, even though as drawings these bodies cannot be further revealed beyond the page or screen. We argue these comics ‘confuse’ gender in different ways: at times by purposefully confounding the possibility of pinpointing a ‘true’ binary gender for non-binary characters, while at others taking a more conservative path of displacing such ‘confusion’ onto the non-binary characters themselves to imply that it is they who are ‘confused’ – while reflecting broader social patterns, this characterizes non-binary gender as though it were not a valid way of being.","2023","2023-11-07 17:38:24","2023-11-17 02:01:43","2023-11-02 17:53:13","1-20","","0","0","","","Figuring it out","","","","","","","en","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2023.2272566","","","","_literature; _fandom; _dnd; _gender; _lgbtq; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned","comics/graphic novels; fandom; Marvel’s Runaways; non-binary gender; The Order of the Stick","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prompt includes heterogeneous data sources: a question itself, an RDF subgraph required to answer the question, and an example of a correct SPARQL query for a different question. In the experiments, GPT-3, a popular pre-trained language model from OpenAI, was leveraged, but it is possible to extend the approach to any other generative LLM. We evaluate, how different types of context in the prompt influence the query generation performance on QALD-9, QALD-10 and Bestiary dataset (BESTIARY), which was created to test LLM performance on unseen data, and provide a detailed error analysis. One of the findings is that providing the model with the underlying KG and a random correct query improve the generation results. The approach shows strong results on QALD-9 dataset, but doesn’t generalize on QALD-10 and BESTIARY, which can be caused by memorization problem.","2023","2023-11-07 17:38:24","2023-11-16 15:07:21","","1-7","","8","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA; _ai ml llm; _non peer-reviewed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Completing ethnographic research through and about the pandemic required a radical reframing of my methodology, not only during the research but also afterward as I began writing. How do you explain what it was like to live, play, and research during such a profound and collective experience? I studied face-to-face tabletop roleplaying (ttrpg) game communities, their process of losing the table, and finding it again online. The purpose of the interactivity in the piece is to bring to bear the experiences of living through a pandemic and political unrest, which melded pain and play together through the tools of play found within the community I observed and participated in, that of the ttrpg players in the Midwest, USA. This particular piece is a rumination on the methodology of writing, what my experience means in this context, and explores the what, how, and why of tools being used. Some of these tools will be utilized here where space allows.","2023-11-08","2023-11-13 20:35:03","2023-12-14 09:53:03","2023-11-13 20:33:51","","","4","","","","Pause to Reflect","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Laya Liebeseller","","","","www.jarps.net","","Number: 4","","","","_anthropology; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _SOCIOLOGY","play; interactive story","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study was to collect and analyse actual responses to see how they aligned with the theoretical reasons found by reviewing the literature. The data were collected through a survey using Google Forms. The survey was shared in groups on Facebook and Discord specialising in cosmic horror role-playing. The results show that there is a strong negative correlation between age and wanting to learn the rules of Call of Cthulhu through the introductory gamebook Alone Against the Flames. Another major reason for playing these solo gamebooks was the difficulty in gathering a group to play traditional Call of Cthulhu. This problem seemed to affect older players more than younger ones. Overall, the findings reveal a diverse set of reasons why people have been playing the various gamebooks in the series.","2023-11-08","2023-11-13 20:41:03","2023-12-14 09:53:01","2023-11-13 20:41:03","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Peter Clynes","","","","www.jarps.net","","Number: 4","","","","_lovecraft; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _CYOA","gamebooks; Alone Against the Flames; Call of Cthulhu; Chaosium; Cosmic Horror","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These elements are discussed in the perspective of the author designing a gamebook and that of a reader navigating the text. The discussion allows us to understand the surprising resilience of the gamebook in today's digitally mediated world, as it is precisely its material nature that gives it a unique positioning in the field of interactive entertainment. After demonstrating the relevance of the gamebook in the present, the article discusses the material elements of the gamebook's three components: the section, the text, and the link. We see how the partition of the work into sections may interfere with the partition of the physical artifact into pages; how the inalterable fabric of the text can relate to a population of diverse readers; and how the explicit nature of the links can create peculiar types of spoilers. The impact of the spatial disposition of the sections in the book is discussed also. Next, the article analyzes the tension between the structure of the gamebook, which proceeds by prescribed reading paths, and the fact that the book is materially open to unauthorized interactions. The discussion focuses on purposeful departures from prescribed reading paths (cheating) and cases in which the author creatively exploited the material nature of the gamebook through mechanisms that require abandoning the narrative tree to be fully appreciated.","2023-11-08","2023-11-13 20:41:07","2023-12-14 09:52:58","2023-11-13 20:41:07","","","4","","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Marco Arnaudo","","","","www.jarps.net","","Number: 4","","","","_peer reviewed; =cleaned; _CYOA","gamebooks; Choose Your Own Adventure; Fighting Fantasy; interactivity; reader-oriented theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ARGs are narrative-driven experiences that include interactive challenges across online and offline settings. They draw on elements of Live Action Roleplaying Games and Method acting without replicating either. ARGs are characterized by a “This Is Not a Game” aesthetic that blurs fiction and reality. Unlike literary or cinematic works of fiction, which engage in a suspension of disbelief, ARGs facilitate a production of belief.

As such, it raises fears about the immersion it is supposed to produce, an extreme involvement that could blur the discernment of its users. The traditional criticism of the “perfect illusion” linked to the experience of the theater for the uneducated spectator thus reappears in discussion of these new practices. However, the study of the different forms of agency and environment proposed by these fictions shows that many counter-immersive factors prevent ludic engagement from turning into belief.","2023","2023-11-14 20:46:59","2024-01-13 16:44:49","","209-217","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","DOI:10.4324/9781003119456-19","","","","_immersion; _pretend play; _worldbuilding; _collaborative; _motivation; _religion; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","James, Alison; Kubo, Akihiro; Lavocat, Françoise","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the recent increase in research on fiction, there is no theoretical account of how memory of fictional information is related to other types of memory or of which mechanisms allow people to separate fact and fiction in memory. We present a theoretical framework that places memory of fiction in relation to other cognitive phenomena as a distinct construct and argue that it is an essential component for any general theory of human memory. We show how fictionality can be integrated in an existing memory model by extending Rubin’s dimensional conceptual memory model. By this means, our model can account for explicit and implicit memory of fictional information of events, places, characters, and objects. Further, we propose a set of mechanisms involving various degrees of complexity and levels of conscious processing that mostly keep fact and fiction separated but also allow information from fiction to influence real-world attitudes and beliefs: content-based reasoning, source monitoring, and an associative link from the memory to the concept of fiction.","2023-11-02","2023-11-16 14:35:59","2023-11-16 15:04:52","2023-11-16 14:35:59","17456916231202500","","","","","Perspect Psychol Sci","Memory of Fictional Information","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","","","_pretend play; _bias; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _cognition; =cleaned; _OTHER GAMES; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By discussing key design choices and reflections from initial playtests (12 participants total, 7M, 5F, aged 1840), this paper offers insight into how opportunities for pivotal play and learning may be created or enhanced within games.","2023","2023-11-23 13:43:19","2023-11-24 15:46:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_dnd; _TTRPG; _transformative; =cleaned; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY; _DESIGN; _designing rpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is a gap between source material of a game and the actual play of it. Our chapter explores this gap with two objectives: first, the authors review what kind of queer existence is possible in tabletop, online multiplayer, and live-action role-playing. Second, this chapter addresses how players negotiate with these “urtexts” in carving out queer potentials. Drawing from numerous examples, the authors conclude that the emergence of queer play necessitates the affordances of the urtext of the game, each player’s unique approach to play, and the core player group or online community in which the play is situated.","2018","2023-11-23 14:02:55","2023-11-24 15:46:32","2023-11-23 14:02:55","167-184","","","","","","Cues for Queer Play","Palgrave Games in Context","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-90542-6_10","","","","_lgbtq; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP","Larpent; Queer Existence; Queer Play; Role-playing Games (RPGs); Tabletop RPGs","Harper, Todd; Adams, Meghan Blythe; Taylor, Nicholas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The comic book series DIE (2019-2021) by Kieron Gillen, Stephanie Hans, and Clayton Cowles is a queer negotiation of Fantasy genre culture, represented here through the microcosm of a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG). Through the journey of the genderfluid protagonist Ash, Gillen implies that queer voices are one means of ‘saving' the Fantasy genre - however, the queer subject must first understand and celebrate their own authority. This article examines DIE’s use of the TTRPG to encapsulate a snapshot of contemporary Fantasy genre culture, before exploring how and why the queer subject is treated as newly empowered within this imaginative ecosystem. Gillen utilises TTRPGs’ capacity as a metatext to comment on Fantasy’s history, traditions, and contemporary climate, and positions Die itself as a ‘grimdark’ setting, treating this subgenre as the epitome of the trends of hypermasculinity within Fantasy’s canon. The comics then explore Ash’s struggle against the self-imposed limitations that result from existing as boundlessly queer within a subculture working to limit them. It is only through Ash’s disruptive manipulation of desire, and acceptance of themselves, that they can progress in DIE’s final quest, take on the mantle of hero and author, and save the world that stands for Fantasy itself. TTRPGs are therefore shown to not simply enshrine Fantasy’s legacy, rather they enable players to also respond to it transformatively. Alongside the context of Ash’s queer subjectivity, DIE implies that a generative future of Fantasy lies with these newly empowered creators, who grapple with the genre’s conservative traditions and remake them anew.","2023","2023-11-23 14:14:59","2023-11-24 15:46:32","","39-54","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_literature; _fandom; _lgbtq; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building on the impulse at the heart of experiential and immersive theater to place the audience within the world of the performance and center their experience, I explore what it means for theater artists to cede control over how audiences make meaning of their work in favor of letting narrative emerge from the participation of the audience during the performance event. I propose a framework called pervasive performance that merges theatrical frames and methods with pervasive gaming, which expands the magic circle of play and blurs the distinction between the game and everyday life. This union of ideas puts audience members in contact with one another and allows them to be playful and co-author the overall performance experience. Further, the blurring of the performance and everyday life transforms audience members’ relationship to the real world and gives them space to imagine and experiment with other worlds and ways of being in them. I devised an alternate reality game (ARG) at UMass Amherst in May 2023, and in my thesis I analyze this project and the process of creating it as a case study in pervasive performance.","2023","2023-11-23 14:15:08","2023-11-24 15:46:32","2023-11-23 14:12:50","","118","","","","","Collaborative Storytelling in The Parable Task","","","","","University of Massachusetts Amherst","","en","","Masters Theses","","","DOI.org (Datacite)","","DOI:10.7275/35673106.0","","","","_immersion; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _LARP; _DESIGN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rollenspiel als Methode der Bildung","","","","https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1814582/FULLTEXT01.pdf","As with any educational modality, no guarantees can be made about efficacy and consistency across student populations. Therefore, when we discuss didactics and RPGs, we refer to their potential. Because RPGs are a form of experiential learning, within which players interact with each other in shared co-creativity, our experience and research indicates that their didactic potential is heightened, particularly along specific cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions (Bowman 2014). Additionally, because RPGs are multimodal, meaning they have multiple methods of engagement operating at the same time, students have the possibility to train several skills and practice working with multiple bases of knowledge at once. Notably, this strength of RPGs can also be considered a weakness depending on the context. RPGs are often far more chaotic than typical classroom activities, as each student is granted more agency to make meaningful choices than is usually permitted in educational settings. Sometimes, teachers may feel out of control or ill-equipped to handle this comparatively chaotic energy (Larsson 2004, p. 247; Harder 2007, p. 234; Hyltoft 2010, p. 51). Additionally, RPGs’ multimodal nature often means that students are engaging in multiple activities at the same time, with their associated thought processes and emotional reactions. Thus, a challenge for educational RPG designers and facilitators is in finding ways to make sure the activity centers upon the specific learning objective and/or curricular goals. Additionally, educators should be aware of some of the central concepts in both role-playing theory and in didactics in order to make informed choices in the classroom. This chapter will explain some of the key concepts in these areas, applying them to learning situations involving RPGs.","2024-04-30","2023-11-24 15:49:39","2024-01-13 16:27:54","2023-11-24 15:47:56","","","","","","","GM Screen","","","","","System Matters Pub","Gelsenkirchen","en","","","","","www.academia.edu","","","","","","_identity; _empathy; _role taking; _metagame; _conflict; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _theoretical work; _LARP; _LEARNING","","Robertz, FJ; Fischer, K","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article weaves together a plethora of theories from psychology, Counseling, and role-playing game studies in an effort to understand the nature of enacted roles, their relationship to identity, and their transformative potential. Challenging the notion that identity is a fixed, stable monolith, the article synthesizes four overall approaches to theorizing the nature of identity drawn from various theories: identity as a social construct, narrative identity, identity as psychodynamic, and identities as parts of a whole. The authors posit that these ways of framing identity can help role-players, designers, and facilitators better understand the multifaceted nature of selfhood.

So-called ‘popular’ or ‘pop’ culture (cinema, genre fiction, TV-series, comics, graffiti, computer and video games, rock and heavy music, radio serials, among others) often makes use of narratives and motifs drawn from the observation and study of ancient Egypt, updated and reinterpreted in various ways, and which is now the subject of study by scholars of Egyptology.

Unfortunately, we forget our cultural identity, that which belongs to us by the simple fact of having been born in our place of origin, which characterizes us and makes us different from the other cultures that exist in the world. Preschool education is an opportunity to foster the cultural identity of the community through playful activities that promote the promotion, knowledge, valuation and appreciation of traditions, customs, Mayan language, among other elements that characterize and identify Yucatecan students. The objective of this article is to identify the strategies used by preschool teachers to transmit the Yucatecan cultural identity through the tradition of Hanal Pixán to their students; likewise, to design a playful proposal using role-playing as a strategy to approach the aforementioned theme and tradition. The study was conducted under the qualitative approach, using the action-research design and was developed in a Kindergarten, located in the city of Merida, Yucatan; to collect the information, a survey and an observation script were used as data collection instruments. The survey allowed us to identify the pre-school teachers' conception of Yucatecan cultural identity and the strategies they use to transmit Yucatecan cultural identity to their students. As results, it was obtained that teachers generally use strategies where students observe the characteristic elements of cultural identity such as traditional clothing, traditional utensils and ancestral practices, using technological resources such as videos and images. Similarly, a role-playing game entitled ""Chiich ¿Dónde está el pib?"" was designed for preschool students in the kindergartens of Merida, Yucatan, with the purpose of transmitting the Yucatecan cultural identity through the Hanal Pixan festivity.","2023-11-24","2023-11-28 16:57:02","2023-11-28 17:53:44","","","","2","2","","","","","","","","","","es","","","","","","","","","","","_anthropology; _history; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; _classroom rpg; =cleaned; _yo1-12; _LEARNING","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ambas prácticas también están ligadas a hacer presentes, a través de los juegos de apariencia y la simulación corporal, universos narrativos ya sea completos, fragmentados o recombinados. La ponencia propuesta busca explorar estas relaciones y variaciones entre el larp y el cosplay a partir de las teorías de consumo narrativo y de la base de datos propuestas por Eiji Otsuka (2010, 2017) y Hiroki Azuma (2009), respectivamente. En primer lugar, se examinarán los elementos que componen estas prácticas como juegos y como puestas en escena, así como sus funciones mediadora y mediática en los procesos de consumo y producción simbólica narrativa. En segunda instancia, se situará tanto el LARP, en tanto juego de rol, como el cosplay, en una genealogía de universos de sentido transmedia/media mix; examinando algunos puntos clave en el origen, desarrollo y relación de ambas prácticas, siendo que han estado atravesadas e interferidas por mercados e industrias de entretenimiento. Para este propósito, además de los autores mencionados, se recuperará la aproximación genealogista y ecológica de Marc Steinberg (2012) a los sistemas de mediación y mediatización de la cultura popular contemporánea. Both LARP (live-action role-play) and cosplay (embodied representations of characters from popular media culture) are manifestations within the broad spectrum of performance phenomena, understood as the staged conclusion and reactivation of a lived experience. Both practices are also linked to making present, through games of appearance and body simulation, narrative universes, whether they be staged in a complete, fragmented or recombined way. This paper aims to explore the relationships and variations between LARP and cosplay using the theories of narrative consumption (Otsuka, 2010, 2017) and database consumption (Azuma, 2009). First, the symbolic elements and mediatic roles within these practices as stagings and games will be examined. Second, both LARP and cosplay, will be placed in a genealogy of transmedia/media mix universes; examining some key points in the origin, development and relationship of both practices, such as how they have been informed and interfered by cultural and entertainment markets and industries.

It was an essential read for me while directing and producing the Official D&D documentary but I’d recommend it to anyone regardless of the subject material. It’s a wild and fun ride through the turbulent history of one the most influential brands in our lifetime."" - JOE MANGANIELLOCo-created by wargame enthusiasts Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson, the original Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game released by TSR (Tactical Studies Rules) in 1974 created a radical new medium: the role-playing game. For the next two decades, TSR rocketed to success, producing multiple editions of D&D, numerous settings for the game, magazines, video games, New York Times bestselling novels by Margaret Weis, Tracy Hickman, and R. A. Salvatore, and even a TV show! But by 1997, a series of ruinous choices and failed projects brought TSR to the edge of doom―only to be saved by their fiercest competitor, Wizards of the Coast, the company behind the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering.Unearthed from Ben Riggs’s own adventurous campaign of in-depth research, interviews with major players, and acquisitions of secret documents, Slaying the Dragon reveals the true story of the rise and fall of TSR. Go behind the scenes of their Lake Geneva headquarters where innovative artists and writers redefined the sword and sorcery genre, managers and executives sabotaged their own success by alienating their top talent, ignoring their customer fanbase, accruing a mountain of debt, and agreeing to deals which, by the end, made them into a publishing company unable to publish so much as a postcard.As epic and fantastic as the adventures TSR published, Slaying the Dragon is the legendary tale of the rise and fall of the company that created the role-playing game world.","2022-07-19","2023-11-29 14:39:02","2023-11-29 14:41:14","","","304","","","","","Slaying the Dragon","","","","","St. Martin's Press","","en","","","","","Amazon","","https://read.macmillan.com/lp/slaying-the-dragon/","","","","_TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"3GGSN7D3","bookSection","2024","Bowman, Sarah Lynne; Westborg, Josefin","Cheat Sheet : What We Can Learn from Edu-Larp and Other(Non-TT) RPGs","#eduRPG.Rollenspiel als Methode der Bildung","","","","https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-516611","To further our discussion of the didactic potential of RPGs, this chapter will discuss the basics of live action role-playing games (larp), as well as adjacent phenomena. We will consider three main larp formats: boffer, chamber, and freeform. We will discuss similarities and differences between these formats and tabletop role-playing games, particularly with regard to their educational potential, their connection to social-emotional learning, and their potency as a result of their somatic, embodied nature. We will emphasize how many larp formats offer players the opportunity to experience a significant amount of agency to make meaningful choices and create play emergently. Tabletop role-playing games can range in scope, intensity, and level of performative enactment. A dungeon crawl featuring only dice rolling, out-of-character strategizing, and combatactions is technically considered a role-playing game, as are games with no dice, no game masters, no combat, and intense immersion into character. In general, the more that players experience embodiment of their character and their performance of the fiction, the closer a game becomes to a larp, although some larps can feature off-game strategizing as well. Embodiment refers to the player physically behaving as they imagine their character would, considering their character in the first-person, i.e. instead of “My character goes to talk to the bartender,” saying “I go talk to the bartender” and/or physically walking up to someone portraying the bartender and speaking to them. Note that for our purposes, embodiment in this case can take place when sitting around a table playing a TTRPG, as some people choose to wear costumes and enact their characters deeply, but the more physical these actions become, the more the game becomes a larp. For example, a group may be playing a game of Fiasco around the table, then choose to physically improvise their characters actions instead of describing them, which is more akin to a larp. Such players may even say, “We got up and larped our game of Fiasco.” As a format, larp is also wide and ranges in scope, intensity, and level of performative enactment. Thus, it becomes difficult to generalize about larp, as different play groups use the term to describe vastly distinct behaviors -- or may not use the term at all when describing behaviors identical to what other groups call “larp.” In general, we define larp as co-creative experiences where participants immerse into fictional characters and realities in an embodied manner for a bounded period of time through emergent playfulness. However, this definition could also be applied to other types of role-playing, such as psychodrama, Drama in Education, improvisation, simulation, and reenactment, as we will discuss in this chapter. Thus, we will refine our definition to focus specifically upon games that have emerged from the RPG subcultures of some kind, whether through the influence of Dungeons & Dragons (1974) or other subcultural roots. For example, in Russia, larp emerged in the 1990s as groups of players inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien began to run larps based on the books entitled Hobbit Games (Semenov 2010). This refinement of the definition allows us to identify larps that have been designed explicitly for educational goals and note how and why their contributions to pedagogy are unique, i.e. edu-larps (Bowman 2014). For example, if an educational role-playing game was designed inspired by leisure games and includes mechanics of some sort, some sort of fantastic setting, win conditions, and persistent co-creation in a consistent fictional world, we can consider it an edu-larp (Bowman and Standiford 2015). However, a larp inspired by the Nordic larp tradition featuring no mechanics, full embodiment of character, no win conditions, i.e. “playing to lose,” in a socially realistic setting such as a prison can also be an edu-larp (Aarebrot & Nielsen, 2012) Similarly, a nursing simulation in which health professionals role-play that includes techniques from Nordic or American freeform -- a tabletop/larp hybrid form -- can also be considered an edu-larp (Standiford 2014). However, the pedagogical goals may be the same as in other types of role-playing in educational and therapeutic settings. Thus, in this chapter, we will further explain and define these cousin forms of larp in order to be precise with our terminology. Regardless of definition, embodied role-playing and storytelling are human activities that likely predate the written language. Humans often learn, educate, practice behaviors and bond through embodied play, as evidenced in childhood pretend play (Bowman & Lieberoth 2018; Kapitany 2022).These different manifestations of embodied role-playing are specific to the socio-cultural contexts within which they emerged, but have many of the same benefits regardless of form. Similarly, many of the benefits of larp can also be achieved through TTRPGs. Thus, this chapter will conclude by discussing the ways in which socio-emotional learning can be enhanced further through physical embodiment as a result of bridging the mental and somatic gap.","2024","2023-11-30 14:33:22","2024-02-09 15:51:34","2023-11-30 14:29:13","","","","","","","Cheat Sheet","","","","","System Matters Verlag","Gelsenkirchen","en","","","","","www.diva-portal.org","","","","","","_nordic larp; _transformative; _medecine-nursing; =cleaned; _LARP; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","Robertz, Frank J.; Fischer, Kathrin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The game is an intellectual property which belongs to Wizards of the Coast, which is itself a subsidiary of the much larger toy company Hasbro. The granularity of the specific game’s IP, relative to the scope of Hasbro’s enterprise, renders conventional data such as stock prices ineffective for demonstrating the effect of a boycott. Therefore, data was instead collected from social media sites YouTube, and Reddit, and analysed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in order to create a snapshot of the conversational space on the sites. The YouTube data sample contains 6 months’ worth of videos content (n=1064 videos, ≈257 hours) by 21 influencers who cover various pen-and-paper roleplaying games, though predominantly Dungeons & Dragons. The Reddit data sample contains 41.455 posts made on the Reddit subforum /r/Pathfinder2e, between March 28th 2018 and April 30th 2023. Following a controversial event which occurred in early January 2023, this study shows that a number of significant changes happened within the two communities. These effects are also in line with literature on Psychological Ownership, and on building communitarian solidarity in Disclosing New Worlds’. First, the focus of the video content being published on YouTube changed significantly. Second, /r/Pathfinder2e experienced an unprecedented level of user activity, primarily as a result of players abandoning Dungeons & Dragons in favour of playing Pathfinder instead. Third, a connection is drawn between the YouTube video content being published about the event, and activity on /r/Pathfinder2e. The study concludes with a discussion of why the resulting changes are important for Wizards of the Coast, and how the techniques used in for analysis may be used to understand the effect of boycotts, and what the requirements are.","2023","2023-12-11 22:02:44","2024-01-13 15:56:43","","","72","","","","","","","","","","Copenhagen Business School","Copenhagen","en","","Master’s Thesis Accounting, Strategy, and Control","","","Zotero","","","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _copyright; _publishing; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The subversive potential of TRPGs is examined through a framework which combines narrative studies with cultural studies and the analysis of two case studies. The trans-textual and transmedial examination conducted on the two most influential TRPGs, Dragons & Dragons and World of Darkness, has revealed that TRPGs narratives are constantly evolving to reflect cultural shifts.

Additionally, such remediation often exhibits “hypomediacy,” the denial of game design mediation, with important consequences for how useful digital games have become for institutional projects and their claims about reality. Anthropological treatments of ritual, and specifically how the engagement of audiences with ambiguous performances produces the real for participants, point toward important implications for digital games, where the infrastructural game elements may underwrite a similar process of reality construction through player performance. My overall suggestion is that when we give the cultural form of game its due (as we have for ritual and bureaucracy) – that is, when we incorporate a robust consideration of game features into our analyses – we will be in a better position to illuminate the ways in which our engagement with digital infrastructure is fraught with claims about the real.","2022-09-30","2024-01-09 19:50:34","2024-01-13 16:52:14","2024-01-09 19:49:28","103-116","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","London","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.4324/9781003175605-11","","","","_immersion; _pretend play; _dnd; _mechanics; _collaborative; series:gygax-actuarial-quantified-self; _sandbox; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _MEDIA; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","Costa, Elisabetta; Lange, Patricia G.; Haynes, Nell; Sinanan, Jolynna","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is no scholarly consensus on the definition of ergodic literature. In this paper, building upon the views of various scholars, I argue that ergodic literature should not be defined by its specific elements, but rather by the unique experience ergodic works co-create with their participants. I analyze the role-playing game Dungeons &amp; Dragons to demonstrate how its unique balance of formal, material, and efficient limitations create coercive mimeticism. It is this coercive mimeticism, I argue, that grants Dungeons &amp; Dragons its status as ergodic; however, as we will see, not all ergodic works require coercive mimesis. I argue that the balance of formal, material, and efficient limitations takes different forms depending on the work and who engages with it. Consequently, there is no universal definition of ergodic literature and every ergodic work must be considered on a case-by-case basis.","2023-12-19","2024-01-09 19:50:34","2024-01-13 15:31:43","2024-01-09 19:48:29","78-88","","1","9","","","A Winding Path","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c) 2023 Mackenzie Hilton","","","","theijournal.ca","","Number: 1","","","","_literature; _dnd; _publishing; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _CYOA; _non peer-reviewed","Dungeons & Dragons; book history; ergodic; mimesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By exploring the various applications of the hugely popular tabletop role-playing game, there are several aspects in which students and teachers can explore in order to find practical as well as theoretical uses for a role-playing game of this size and scope. This study has discussed and analyzed the benefits and drawbacks of implementing Dungeons & Dragons in the EFL classroom through mental imagery and immersion as an effective teaching tool.

As a space distinctive to early TTRPGs it is characterised by asymmetry between the dungeon as an object of design, and the dungeon as a practice of play. The discourse of games manuals, independent publications and blogs emerging from the TTRPG scene tracks the origins and evolution of these procedural and labyrinthine spaces, and the distinct spatiality of the megadungeon as a geographical object. The space of the megadungeon can be mapped onto a Lefebvrian triad of spatial production: it exists as a representation of space produced by a dungeon master or algorithmic generation that forms an infrastructure of play; it exists as a spatial practice emerging out of the unique experience of players traversing the megadungeon; and it forms a space of representation by seeking to imagine the megadungeon as a living fictional world, intersecting with the assumptions about spatial norms and relations originating in tropes of fantasy fiction. Surveying these trends in conversation with recent insights from human geography illustrates the distinct spatiality of the megadungeon that is derived from its origins in TTRPG play. This brings forward important questions for the utility of the megadungeon as a metaphor for digital media ecologies, and asks whether the metaphor could be extended to enrich conceptual debates in human geography.","2023","2024-01-09 19:50:34","2024-01-13 15:31:43","","191-218","","2","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","_dungeon crawl; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _designing rpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, TRPGs and their players historically have experienced significant stigmatization due to the misconception by some that fantasy role play leads to psychological dysfunction. While a large body of research exists to the contrary, many mental health professionals still believe that TRPG players are at higher risk for mental health concerns. These studies have the potential to contrast this misconception by offering insight into how this community resembles as well as contrasts the general population psychologically and linguistically. The objective of this dissertation research was twofold. The first manuscript used a computer-assisted text analysis design to analyze the TRPG blogging discourse by comparing it to blogging in general via 17 variables from three categories: broad psycholinguistic processes (authenticity, clout, tone, and analytic), linguistic processes (1st-person singular pronouns, 3rd-person singular pronouns, 1st-person plural pronouns, and 3rd-person plural pronouns), and psychological processes (positive emotion, negative emotion, friend, affiliation, achievement, power, reward, risk, and leisure). The variables were selected based on a review of the literature regarding psychology and TRPGs. Regarding the broad psycholinguistic variables, the results indicated the largest differences between the corpora in the analytic and authentic variables. One linguistic variable, 1st-person singular pronouns, also showed significant difference. The results indicate that TRPG bloggers' discourse differs from blogging in general in their emphasis on resolving interpersonal conflict in the gameplay process. Understanding these themes in TRPG blogging discourse provides deeper insight into the worldview of these individuals, which might assist counselors in building cultural competence in working with this population. The second manuscript used a different corpus linguistic technique to identify the keywords, multiword terms, and the word networks of the keywords that differentiate TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The keyness analysis identified the words “dnd” and “homebrew” as the two keywords and “bonus action” and “spell slot” as the multiword terms that differentiated TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The word networks of “dnd” and “homebrew” emphasized both the unique lexicon of TRPG play, as well as the emphasis on group dynamics in this form of play. These results emphasize the creative potential of TRPG play along with the commitment players feel towards ensuring that gameplay is fair and enjoyable for everyone involved. Counselors and other mental health professionals can use the findings of these studies to increase their knowledge of the values and worldviews of the TRPG player community. This could also help clinicians provide more culturally competent care and harness the creative potential of TRPGs in the therapeutic process.","2023","2024-01-09 19:50:34","2024-01-13 15:55:08","2024-01-09 19:30:58","","","","","","","","","","","","Oregon State University","","en","","Ph.D. Counseling","","","","","","","","","_fandom; _dnd; _publishing; _data; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA; _serial; _text mining/text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Please describe an example from your own play.” Common themes in responses were connected to three key elements of D&D’s design: gameplay, role-play, and storytelling. We subsequently identify 1) the importance of D&D’s “critical” dice-roll mechanic, 2) how D&D enables memorable role-play, and 3) the enduring appeal of heroic stories. By emphasizing how elements of D&D’s design can impact players’ experiences and enjoyment of the game, this paper offers new insights into the appeal of D&D which go beyond simplistic descriptions of the game being ‘fun’ or ‘social’.","2024-01-03","2024-01-09 19:50:34","2024-01-13 15:34:49","2024-01-09 19:27:50","10","","","","","","Memorable Play in Dungeons & Dragons","","","","","","","en","","","","","scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu","","","","","","_immersion; _assessment; _group dynamics; _dnd; _dice; _playfulness; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _empirical work; _DESIGN; _GAMEPLAY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Textually orientated discourse analysis is combined with content analysis to examine the illustrations used in over 100 magazines, both in terms of their cover pages and advertising content, in order to establish and examine their dominant tropes. Findings show the imagery used on the magazines prioritised certain themes and identities whilst excluding others. As such these texts acted as sites of masculine role-play, with idealised bodies and minds set within a network of fetishistic Fantasy and hi-tech environs.

Their success or failure often depends on randomizers like cards or dice. Regarding the latter, the most commonly used in RPGs are the Platonic solids with the addition of the ten-sided die. They are commonly simulated through classical computers, however, since true randomness is not in their nature, they can only generate pseudorandom numbers. On the contrary, quantum computers exploit the nondeterministic nature of quantum mechanics, so they are perfect candidates for truly random simulations in games of chance. For this reason, this paper proposes and tests various quantum circuits for sampling uniformly distributed discrete values within a fixed range, corresponding to the number of faces of the dice. The simulations reveal the pure randomness of the output of the implemented circuits. They were then used to generate random numbers within a three-dimensional dice-rolling game.","2023-08","2024-01-09 19:50:34","2024-01-13 15:37:09","2024-01-09 19:09:20","1-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2325-4289","","","","_dice; _probability; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _stem; _GAMEPLAY","Computers; Programming; Integrated circuit modeling; Noise measurement; Phase measurement; Quantum computing; Quantum mechanics; Random number generation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2023 IEEE Conference on Games (CoG)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reference is drawn from the concept of the dungeon, which has been successfully introduced into the realm of role-playing games since the 1970s. Conventionally, a dungeon refers to a complex, multi-level maze of corridors, tunnels, rooms, and hidden chambers. The nature of dungeons is to be theoretically infinite floor plans that game designers have learned to produce algorithmically: when they cross a certain size threshold, they are known as megadungeons. In this article, I propose the megadungeon as a productive topological model that intersects different sociotechnical aspects of digital media, drawing on shared characteristics such as a layered structure, labyrinthine exploration, game-derived grammar, and an affinity with computational domain. Additionally, the essay proposes comparisons with similar representation models that challenge outdated cartographic metaphors and addresses specific connections between new media and the concepts of verticality and stratification.","2023-12-19","2024-01-09 19:50:34","2024-01-13 15:54:27","2024-01-09 19:00:55","219-244","","2","4","","mag","Megadungeon","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","_dungeon crawl; _sandbox; _peer reviewed; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _DESIGN; _designing rpg","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"AV5A8Y5L","thesis","2023","Scholte Albers, Maxime","But I am a wizard: Character bleed in Dungeons & Dragons","","","","","http://arno.uvt.nl/show.cgi?fid=162922","Recently Role Playing Games (RPGs), in specific Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), have sparked in popularity, with mainstream media such as films and series picking up on the phenomenon as well. Particularly during COVID-19 and with the stay-at-home measures, more people have started playing D&D which has been shown to have a positive effect on their players’ well-being, underscoring the potential mental health benefits of the game. Academics have so far focussed on areas such as how physical customization possibilities of game characters can affect players or how a bond forms between players and characters. However, little attention has been paid to how a character’s personality design and customization options affect the player. This research focuses on how personality design and customization options of the game of D&D affect the player in terms of character bleed over an extended period through a longitudinal experiment. Character bleed in short is the transfer of aspects of the self into the character (e.g. emotions, behavior, beliefs) and vice versa. A new measurement for character bleed was developed and tested for this purpose. Results show that playing a character close to your own personality leads to more character bleed-in than character bleed-out, and playing a character whose personality you wish to have or playing a character whose personality is opposite to your own equally leads to bleed-in and bleed-out. The results also show that when players play a character that has an opposite personality to their own, there is more bleed-out experienced than when they play a character close to their own personality. Continuing, the study provides helpful insights and further directions for future research, such as further developing and validating the measurement tool for character bleed, with the aim to discover how RPGs like D&D and character creation can create a healthcare tool to improve one’s wellbeing.","2023","2024-01-15 16:53:03","2024-01-15 16:55:10","2024-01-15 16:46:33","","68","","","","","","","","","","Tilburg University","","en","","Master Thesis in Linguistics","","","","","","","","","_bleed; _dnd; _TTRPG; _covid19; _PSYCHOLOGY; _EMOTIONS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of all gamification, role playing and SEL, and the satanic panic that came out against Dungeons & Dragons are looked at. This paper additionally looks at some examples of role playing in the classroom that have succeeded at a small charter school in Minneapolis. These findings underscore the equity achieved by allowing for student choice when planning how they will show their mastery of what we are working on. In addition, this practice allows students to work on something they care about, which evens the playing field for all parties involved.","2023-10-01","2024-01-23 03:19:48","2024-01-23 03:20:45","","","60","","","","","","","","","","Hamline University","Saint Paul","en","","School of Education and Leadership Student Capstone Projects","","","Zotero","","","","","","_TTRPG; _classroom rpg; _LEARNING; _stem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a game that integrates highly performative elements into its gameplay, DnD is uniquely able to harness play as a means of facilitating players to engage with performance. This thesis is focused on investigating this phenomenon and theorizing on ways to harness it. Through interviews with six TTRPG players, four main aspects of play in DnD were found: Role-play, Social Interaction, Freedom of Expression, and Storytelling. These are the four main “fun factors” of DnD. Each of these aspects were cross-examined through a performance studies lens as well other disciplinary tools such as the MDA framework, a system for analyzing game design by identifying Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics present in games. Through this process, an experimental game session of DnD was created and play tested by interviewees. Based on findings from interviews and the experimental game session, this thesis concludes that DnD’s primary strength is the creation of a “game-space” for players, a form of protected space in which players are free from external pressures or fears. This space is created by the four fun factors, supported by the framework of a systemized set of rules, and creates a suspension of players’ usual perception of performance, allowing players to engage in performance activities without as much apprehension.","2023-11-14","2024-01-23 14:09:42","2024-01-23 14:20:46","2024-01-23 02:56:13","","","","","","","“When You Play Dnd, You Get to Be More Yourself Than You Are in Real Life”","","","","","National University of Singapore","Singapore","","","Thesis","","","scholarbank.nus.edu.sg","","Accepted: 2024-01-15T05:14:53Z","","","","_identity; _dnd; _TTRPG; _soft skills; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Impairments in social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviorsare often associated with debilitating outcomes for individuals with ASD. Therefore, it is critical to identify successful treatments to address the social deficits characteristic of ASD. This study investigated the effects of a role-playing game (RPG) on social skill acquisition for individuals with ASD. The primary dependent variable was skill acquisition within the context of the RPG setting. Generalization of skill acquisition outside of the game-context and social functioning was also evaluated. Results indicated that the role-playing game improved social skill acquisition across all participants and was rated as a socially valid intervention by both parents and participants. Furthermore, there were mixed results for participants generalized skill acquisition. Future research should incorporate a specific strategy within the role-playing game to promote generalization of skill acquisition.","2019-08-01","2024-01-23 14:14:19","2024-01-23 21:55:25","","","100","","","","","","","","","","University of Southern Mississippi","","en","","PhD Psychology","","","","","","","","","_autism; _assessment; _0.33; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _soft skills; _LEARNING; _PSYCHOLOGY","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Misunderstandings about this unique group resulted in a long-term association of psychological dysfunction with this form of recreation that is still reflected in the views of mental health providers. The present study aimed to dispel some of these myths by using a corpus linguistics design to identify the unique keywords, multiterm words, and the word networks of the keywords that differentiate TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The keyness analysis identified the words “dnd” and “homebrew” as the two keywords and “bonus action” and “spell slot” as the multiword terms differentiating TRPG blogging from blogging in general. The word networks of dnd and homebrew demonstrate the unique linguistic patterns of this group as well as the focus on the communal nature of the TRPG experience. These results highlight the creative nature of TRPG play as well as the fact that this type of gaming focuses as much on the group experience as on any specific player. Counselors can use these findings to increase their cultural competence when working with TRPG players, as well as potentially harness their creative energy in the counseling process.","2024","2024-01-23 21:49:40","2024-01-23 21:55:19","2024-01-23 21:47:57","","","","","","","","","","","","PsyArXiv Preprints","","","","","","","Europe PMC","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/f62m7 Type: article","","","","_fandom; _TTRPG; =cleaned; _MEDIA; _serial; _text mining/text analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet our computational models of these processes are often developed in isolation, without considering how these processes fit together. In this work, we study a simplified variant of the popular board game Codenames, which highlights the integration of two important processes: (1) lexical search and (2) pragmatic reasoning. In this open-ended task, speakers must generate a 'clue' word from their vast lexicon that allows their partner to select a pair of target words from a context of distractors. In Experiment 1, we examine a large corpus of associative reference games to evaluate models of how speakers search for information in their lexicon and ultimately produce informative clues. We find that a two-stage model of pragmatic reasoning built on top of semantic search was best able to predict behavior in the game. In Experiment 2, we explicitly elicit lists of candidate clues that speakers are considering prior to selection. We use these data to evaluate models of semantic search initialized from multiple nodes in the lexical network, and find models that jointly model the search process best account for the behavioral patterns. Finally, in Experiment 3, we examine targeted endorsements for a particularly diagnostic set of clues, which provide further evidence for this integrated model of search and selection. Taken together, our findings suggest that context-sensitivity is infused into both retrieval processes (generating promising candidates) and selection processes (evaluating the likely communicative success of these candidates).","2024","2024-01-25 10:47:11","2024-01-30 03:25:03","2024-01-25 10:47:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Europe PMC","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/3a9kq Type: article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The term – originating from the acronym for live action role-play – refers to a playful practice that has occurred in various locations around the world for at least 50 years. However, its insertion in the political context did not attribute an explicit meaning, so the objective of this study is to identify the meanings used, with the aim of systematizing and discussing them. As a finding, there is a pejorative use of the term, so that the essay ends by proposing other meanings that are linked to the term larp and that could be appropriated by political discussion.","","2024-02-09 11:33:35","2024-02-09 11:33:35","","","","","24","","","","","","","","","","pt","","","","","Zotero","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BN2LKW8Y","book","","Dews, Robin; Stallard, John","Talking Miniatures ...or how the Lincoln Model Railway and Wargames Society changed the world","","978-1-73947-600-7","","","","Talking Miniatures is an exciting new book about the early years of Games Workshop and Citadel Miniatures. Written and compiled by former White Dwarf Editor and Design Studio Manager – Robin Dews, and ex-Citadel/GW Sales Director, now Head of Warlord Games - John Stallard, the book consists of a series of lavishly illustrated conversations with some of the eclectic cast of designers, sculptors, artists, rebels and similar non-conformists who in the early 1980s gravitated towards Bryan Ansell and the early Citadel Miniatures team. More a collection of conversations than a series of interviews, Talking Miniatures, allows the participants to tell us in their own words, exactly what it was like in those very early years. How did that first edition of Warhammer Fantasy Battle come to be written? Who was behind the incredible look and feel of the original Warhammer 40,000 – Rogue Trader? How did the iconic shape of the original RTB01 Space Marines develop, and how did Mike McVey create and then master the mid- 90s GW painting style? All these questions, and hundreds more, are answered in this book in the words, memories and recollections of the people who were actually there and doing these things! In addition to these incredible stories, the book is lavishly illustrated with photographs and images taken from the hundreds of the books, games, magazines and miniatures that Games Workshop has produced over the years. In addition, we have had privileged and unprecedented access to the personal collections of all the participants and present many of these artifacts and miniatures for the very first time. For anyone who has lifted their paintbrush, miniature in hand or rolled a fistful of dice across a tabletop battlefield, Talking Miniatures is an essential read. Even if you are not currently a hobbyist, Talking Miniatures will take you on a thrilling and insightful ride into that magical point where creativity and commerce coincide.","","2024-02-19 20:36:42","2024-02-19 20:45:26","","","492","","","","","","","","","","Shaggy Dog Publishing Ltd","","en","","","","","","","2 volumes","","","","_wargame; _miniature; _TTRPG; _OTHER GAMES; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new edition of Playing at the World is the first of two volumes that update the 720-page original tome of the same name from 2012. This first volume is The Invention of Dungeons & Dragons, which explores the publication of that iconic game. (The second volume is The Three Pillars of Role-Playing Games, a deeper dive into the history of the setting, system, and character of D & D.) In this first volume, Jon Peterson distills the story of how the wargaming clubs and fanzines circulating around the upper Midwest in the 1970s culminated in Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson's seminal role-playing game, D & D. It augments the research of the original editions with new insights into the crucial period in 1972–3 when D & D began to take shape. Drawing from primary sources ranging from eighteenth-century strategists to modern hobbyists, Playing at the World explores the origins of wargames and roleplaying through the history of conflict simulations and the eccentric characters who drove the creation of a signature cultural innovation in the late twentieth century. Filled with unparalleled archival research (from obscure fanzines to letters, drafts, and other ephemera), this new edition of Playing at the World is the ultimate geek's guide to the original RPG. As such, it is an indispensable resource for academics and game fans exploring the origins of the hobby.","2024-06-20","2024-02-22 01:49:00","2024-02-22 02:02:44","2024-02-22 01:49:00","","384","","","","","","","","","","The MIT Press","","en","","","","","","","","","","","_major publication; _dnd; _TTRPG; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ground-breaking study which identifies D&D's true origins includes historical matter concerning the rise of classic D&D from its pre-LGTSA state under Dave Arneson, to the LGTSA play-tests, to its publication in 1974 and immediate post-publication phase from 1974-75. After Arneson emphatically captured Gary’s and the LGTSA's attention with his Blackmoor demo game, it was our turn to fully experience this new system. Several weeks into the new play-tests of the game system Gary, post-game, made an observation that I’ve previously referred to in the preface and is worth noting again: “We’ve created a fourth category in games.” He said this while looking at an indistinct spot in the dining room. He then went on to list the three categories of games that existed at the time… Table-Top Games… Parlor Games… Physical and Outdoor Activity Games… — excerpted from the Introduction to A New Ethos in Game Design. This work describes how Rob Kuntz went on to corroborate Gary Gygax’s monumental assertion. In it he presents the following proofs gleaned from his 16 years of studies and research:     The new system's qualities are meticulously explained     Its unique system architecture is revealed and its operations are explained in detail     Alongside this, Rob asserts that with D&D's original publication, a breakout medium in storytelling — real time story crafting — was created, which corresponds in major ways to traditional oral storytelling.","2024","2024-02-25 03:54:42","2024-02-26 05:02:33","","","41","","","","","","","","","","Three Line Studio","","en","","","","","","","https://threelinestudiostore.company.site/THE-4TH-CATEGORY-p628165080","","","","_arneson; _TTRPG; _HISTORYOFRPG","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Abstract: Quests represent an integral part of role-playing games (RPGs). While evocative, narrative-rich quests are still mostly hand-authored, player demands towards more and richer game content, as well as business requirements for continuous player engagement necessitate alternative, procedural quest generation methods. While existing methods produce mostly uninteresting, mechanical quest descriptions, recent advances in AI have brought forth generative language models with promising computational storytelling capabilities. We leverage two of the most successful Transformer models, GPT-2 and GPT-3, to procedurally generate RPG video game quest descriptions. We gathered, processed and openly published a data set of 978 quests and their descriptions from six RPGs. We fine-tuned GPT-2 on this data set with a range of optimizations informed by several mini studies. We validated the resulting Quest-GPT2 model via an online user study involving 349 RPG players. Our results indicate that one in five quest descriptions would be deemed acceptable by a human critic, yet the variation in quality across individual quests is large. We provide recommendations on current applications of Quest-GPT2. This is complemented by case-studies on GPT-3 to highlight the future potential of state-of-the-art natural language models for quest generation.

The hero’s journey represents the development of the individual to maturity as a result of confrontation with their unconscious shadow side. While this trajectory reflects the human experience, it centers an idealized young male hero who becomes singularly important to saving the world from a villainized monstrous other. Other characters in the story are marginalized and decentered, invalidating other important archetypal characters such as the Heroine, the Mother, the Witch, the Trickster, the Sage, and the Divine. This article will discuss the ways in which analog RPG narratives can offer the general benefits of active, mythic, and ironic imagination. Integrating ethnographic interviews with 4 experts in the field, the article outlines critiques of the hero’s journey and discusses the wide variety of archetypes explorable within these alternative story structures, even in traditional role-playing games (RPGs) such as Dungeons & Dragons. The article will emphasize how players can use these experiences to shape their own narrative identity into more empowering structures of belief and life roadmaps regardless of the type of character they embody.","2024","2024-03-04 07:54:12","2024-03-04 07:54:12","2024-03-04 07:53:54","1-14","","0","0","","","Finding the self in role-playing games","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/25741136.2024.2324085","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

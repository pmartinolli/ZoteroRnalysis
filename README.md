# ZoteroRnalysis
Analyze your Zotero library of references with R, to produce graphics and csv files

- Everything you need to know is self-contained in the `ZoteroRnalysis.R` file.
- The file `My library.csv` is an example of Zotero references to be processed.
- The file `journal_titles_reconciled.csv` is an example of reconciled data with OpenRefine.
- The R program will produce a `output` subfolder with `.pdf` and `.csv` files

Examples of analysis : 
- Distribution of the journal articles, by years of publication
- Journal names, counted and ranked
- Book publisher names, counted and ranked 
- Author names, counted and ranked
- Languages used, counted and ranked
- Number of authors per papers, distributed by year
- Personal tags used, counted, ranked and distributed by year (two levels of tags)
- For each article, what is the time span between the inception year of the journal and the publication year of the articles? (with reconciled data from Wikidata with OpenRefine)
- Distribution of the countries of origins of the journals  (with reconciled data from Wikidata with OpenRefine)
